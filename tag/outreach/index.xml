      <title>SEP acceleration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Solar Energetic Particles are accelerate during solar eruptions,
with the acceleration believed to be connected to the flare processes
and the vast magnetic clouds that are ejected from the Sun at
supersonic speeds into the corona and interplanetary space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the recent past, I worked on SEP acceleration with Rami Vainio
(University of Turku, Finland). Our studies concentrated on SEP
acceleration by the shock waves driven by the mass clouds, and the
text below describes that process and our work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, I plan to amend this text to include also something
about particle acceleration in flares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sep-acceleration-in-shock-waves-driven-by-coronal-mass-ejections&#34;&gt;SEP acceleration in shock waves driven by coronal mass ejections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shock waves in the corona are related to the coronal mass
ejections (CMEs), the vast magnetic structures ejected from the Sun
during the solar eruptions. These CMEs are hurled from the Sun at
velocities faster than the magnetosonic speed, and thus drive a shock
ahead of them, as a supersonic jet does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such shocks are considered as the primary contributor to SEPs in large
events (although this is still debated). The particles are accelerated
by first-order Fermi mechanism, as the particles scatter in the
upstream and downstream of the shock, gaining energy at each crossing
of the shock front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the acceleration mechanism requires scattering, it requires
turbulent magnetic field. With Rami Vainio, we studied the effect of the
accelerated particle streams generating this turbulence themselves. In
this manner, the acceleration process can be bootstrapped: the
accelerated particles amplify the turbulence, making subsequent
acceleration even faster and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acceleration process is, however, highly dynamic, and we have
shown that the intensity of the injected particles is an important
factor for the attainable SEP energies and intensities. In addition,
the acceleration of minor ions depends on the evolution of the proton
acceleration in a considerable way, and the geometry of the coronal
field lines determines the attainable energies of the particles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SEP propagation in interplanetary space</title>
      <link>https://tlml.github.io/project/septransport_outreach/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on improving our understanding on howt he SEPs
propagate in the interplanetary space, to arrive from the Sun to Earth
and beyond. As charged particles, the SEPs are affected by
electromagnetic forces, and thus, in the turbulent plasmas of the
interplanetary space, they do not propagate along a direct path from
the Sun. The follow the large-scale spiral structure, the &amp;ldquo;Parker
Spiral&amp;rdquo;, of the heliospheric magnetic field, and scatter off the
magnetic field irregularities. This propagation is often described as
a combination of diffusion and convection of the particles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the scattering, we must understand the SEP propagation in
the interplanetary space in order to be able to understand how the SEP
acceleration and release at the Sun is related to other phenomena
during a Solar eruption. Unfortunately, our understanding on how to
model the spread of particles into the heliosphere is still far from
complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the spread of particles across the mean
Parker Spiral magnetic field is not properly understood. This is
crucial for both understanding the SEP acceleration mechanisms, and
for the forecasting of SEP intensities at Earth, as currently we
cannot reliably determine whether the width of an SEP event is due to
the width of the acceleration region close to the Sun, or due to the
spreading of the particles in the interplanetary space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our contribution to understanding of the cross-field propagation goes
beyond the diffusion description of the particles, as we follow the
complete orbit of the particle in the turbulent magnetic fields. The
turbulent fields are described as superposition of waves, and the
crucial question is: how to make the modelling of turbulence as
realistic as possible. We have studied in particular the effect of
structuredness of the turbulence using envelopes to &amp;ldquo;break&amp;rdquo; the
turbulence into non-coherent packets, as the turbulence is a nonlinear
phenomenon. Our models can be used to study the rate the particles
spread in space, and how the spreading compares to other, more simple
models.&lt;/p&gt;
