Our studies concentrated on SEP acceleration by the shock waves driven by the mass clouds, and the text below describes that process and our work\nIn the future, I plan to amend this text to include also something about particle acceleration in flares.\nSEP acceleration in shock waves driven by coronal mass ejections The shock waves in the corona are related to the coronal mass ejections (CMEs), the vast magnetic structures ejected from the Sun during the solar eruptions. These CMEs are hurled from the Sun at velocities faster than the magnetosonic speed, and thus drive a shock ahead of them, as a supersonic jet does.\nSuch shocks are considered as the primary contributor to SEPs in large events (although this is still debated). The particles are accelerated by first-order Fermi mechanism, as the particles scatter in the upstream and downstream of the shock, gaining energy at each crossing of the shock front.\nAs the acceleration mechanism requires scattering, it requires turbulent magnetic field. With Rami Vainio, we studied the effect of the accelerated particle streams generating this turbulence themselves. In this manner, the acceleration process can be bootstrapped: the accelerated particles amplify the turbulence, making subsequent acceleration even faster and more efficient.\nThe acceleration process is, however, highly dynamic, and we have shown that the intensity of the injected particles is an important factor for the attainable SEP energies and intensities. In addition, the acceleration of minor ions depends on the evolution of the proton acceleration in a considerable way, and the geometry of the coronal field lines determines the attainable energies of the particles.\n","date":1639417631,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639417631,"objectID":"0194e467b42abe3fee52eab6fb869c32","permalink":"https://tlml.github.io/project/sepacceleration_outreach/","publishdate":"2021-12-13T17:47:11Z","relpermalink":"/project/sepacceleration_outreach/","section":"project","summary":"During solar eruptions, charged particles are accelerated to relativistic speeds.

As charged particles, the SEPs are affected by electromagnetic forces, and thus, in the turbulent plasmas of the interplanetary space, they do not propagate along a direct path from the Sun. The follow the large-scale spiral structure, the \u0026ldquo;Parker Spiral\u0026rdquo;, of the heliospheric magnetic field, and scatter off the magnetic field irregularities. This propagation is often described as a combination of diffusion and convection of the particles.\nBecause of the scattering, we must understand the SEP propagation in the interplanetary space in order to be able to understand how the SEP acceleration and release at the Sun is related to other phenomena during a Solar eruption. Unfortunately, our understanding on how to model the spread of particles into the heliosphere is still far from complete.\nIn particular, the spread of particles across the mean Parker Spiral magnetic field is not properly understood. This is crucial for both understanding the SEP acceleration mechanisms, and for the forecasting of SEP intensities at Earth, as currently we cannot reliably determine whether the width of an SEP event is due to the width of the acceleration region close to the Sun, or due to the spreading of the particles in the interplanetary space.\nOur contribution to understanding of the cross-field propagation goes beyond the diffusion description of the particles, as we follow the complete orbit of the particle in the turbulent magnetic fields. The turbulent fields are described as superposition of waves, and the crucial question is: how to make the modelling of turbulence as realistic as possible. We have studied in particular the effect of structuredness of the turbulence using envelopes to \u0026ldquo;break\u0026rdquo; the turbulence into non-coherent packets, as the turbulence is a nonlinear phenomenon. Our models can be used to study the rate the particles spread in space, and how the spreading compares to other, more simple models.\n","date":1639417631,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639417631,"objectID":"13bf8e3613b410717fab2aa2a7a7c8c4","permalink":"https://tlml.github.io/project/septransport_outreach/","publishdate":"2021-12-13T17:47:11Z","relpermalink":"/project/septransport_outreach/","section":"project","summary":"SEPs originate at the Sun, 150 million km from the Earth.

FDs are thought to be caused by the ICME shock wave or the magnetic flux rope embedded in the ICME inhibiting CR propagation through the ICME structure. FDs are typically modeled as enhanced diffusion within the ICME structure. However, so far modeling has not considered the access of the CRs from the interplanetary field lines into the isolated magnetic field lines of the ICME flux rope. We study the effect of an ICME flux rope on particle propagation by using full-orbit particle simulations, with the interface between the external interplanetary magnetic field and the isolated flux rope field lines modeled analytically. We find that the particles can access the flux rope through the x-point region, where the external magnetic fields cancel the azimuthal component of the rope field. The transport through this region is fast compared to diffusive radial propagation within the rope. As a result, the propagation of CRs into the flux rope can be modeled as diffusion into a cylinder. The density cavity within the rope is asymmetric, and limited to the magnetic field lines isolated from the external field. Thus, in order to evaluate the role of the flux rope in FDs, one must analyze the extent of the region where the flux rope magnetic field lines are separated from the interplanetary magnetic fields.","tags":["Forbush effect","Galactic cosmic rays","Solar coronal mass ejections","Interplanetary physics","Interplanetary magnetic fields","Interplanetary turbulence","546","567","310","827","824","830"],"title":"Access of Energetic Particles to a Magnetic Flux Rope from External Magnetic Field Lines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

However, this is in direct contrast to so-called spike and drop-out events, which indicate very little lateral transport. To better understand these seemingly incongruous observations, we discuss the recent progress made towards understanding and implementing perpendicular diffusion in transport models of SEP electrons. This includes a re-derivation of the relevant focused transport equation, a discussion surrounding the correct form of the pitch-angle dependent perpendicular diffusion coefficient and what turbulence quantities are needed as input, and how models lead to degenerate solutions of the particle intensity. Lastly, we evaluate the validity of a diffusion approach to SEP transport and conclude that it is valid when examining a large number of (an ensemble of) events, but that individual SEP events may exhibit coherent structures related to the magnetic field turbulence at short timescales that cannot be accounted for in this modelling approach.","tags":[],"title":"Perpendicular diffusion of solar energetic particles: When is the diffusion approximation valid?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Solar energetic particles (SEPs) with energy in the GeV range can propagate to Earth from their acceleration region near the Sun and produce ground level enhancements (GLEs). The traditional approach to interpreting and modelling GLE observations assumes particle propagation which is only parallel to the magnetic field lines of interplanetary space, that is, spatially 1D propagation. Recent measurements by PAMELA have characterised SEP properties at 1 AU for the ensuremath∼100 MeV-1 GeV range at high spectral resolution.  Aims: We model the transport of GLE- energy solar protons using a 3D approach to assess the effect of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) and drifts associated to the gradient and curvature of the Parker spiral. We derive 1 AU observables and compare the simulation results with data from PAMELA.  Methods: We use a 3D test particle model including a HCS. Monoenergetic populations are studied first to obtain a qualitative picture of propagation patterns and numbers of crossings of the 1 AU sphere. Simulations for power law injection are used to derive intensity profiles and fluence spectra at 1 AU. A simulation for a specific event, GLE 71, is used for comparison purposes with PAMELA data.  Results: Spatial patterns of 1 AU crossings and the average number of crossings per particle are strongly influenced by 3D effects, with significant differences between periods of A$^+$ and A$^-$ polarities. The decay time constant of 1 AU intensity profiles varies depending on the position of the observer and it is not a simple function of the mean free path as in 1D models. Energy dependent leakage from the injection flux tube is particularly important for GLE energy particles, resulting in a rollover in the spectrum.","tags":["Sun: particle emission","Sun: heliosphere","Sun: activity","magnetic fields","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics - Space Physics"],"title":"3D propagation of relativistic solar protons through interplanetary space","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leon Kocharov","Melissa Pesce-Rollins","Timo Laitinen","Alexander Mishev","Patrick Kühl","Andreas Klassen","Meng Jin","Nicola Omodei","Francesco Longo","David F.

Using the neutron monitor data and interplanetary transport modeling both along and across interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) lines, we deduce parameters of the proton injection into the interplanetary medium. The inferred injection profile of the interplanetary protons is compared with the profile of the \u003e100 MeV ensuremathγ-ray emission observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, attributed to pion production from the interaction of \u003e300 MeV protons at the Sun. GLE 72 started with a prompt component that arrived along the IMF lines. This was followed by a more prolonged enhancement caused by protons arriving at the Earth across the IMF lines from the southwest. The interplanetary proton event is modeled using two sources—one source at the root of the Earth- connected IMF line and another source situated near the solar western limb. The maximum phase of the second injection of interplanetary protons coincides with the maximum phase of the prolonged \u003e100 MeV ensuremathγ-ray emission that originated from a small area at the solar western limb, below the current sheet trailing the associated coronal mass ejection (CME). A possible common source of interacting protons and interplanetary protons is discussed in terms of proton acceleration at the CME bow shock versus coronal (re-)acceleration in the wake of the CME.","tags":["310","1491","1517","1997","1496","1497"],"title":"Interplanetary Protons versus Interacting Protons in the 2017 September 10 Solar Eruptive Event","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

In order to interpret their origin through comparison with remote sensing observations of the solar eruption, we thus must deconvolve the transport effects due to the turbulent magnetic fields from the SEP observations. Recent research suggests that the SEP propagation is guided by the turbulent meandering of the magnetic fieldlines across the mean magnetic field. However, the lengthening of the distance the SEPs travel, due to the fieldline meandering, has so far not been included in SEP event analysis. This omission can cause significant errors in estimation of the release times of SEPs at the Sun. We investigate the distance traveled by the SEPs by considering them to propagate along fieldlines that meander around closed magnetic islands that are inherent in turbulent plasma. We introduce a fieldline random walk model which takes into account the physical scales associated to the magnetic islands. Our method remedies the problem of the diffusion equation resulting in unrealistically short pathlengths, and the fractal dependence of the pathlength of random walk on the length of the random-walk step. We find that the pathlength from the Sun to 1 au can be below the nominal Parker spiral length for SEP events taking place at solar longitudes 45E to 60W, whereas the western and behind-the-limb particles can experience pathlengths longer than 2 au due to fieldline meandering.","tags":["Solar energetic particles","Heliosphere","Interplanetary turbulence","Interplanetary physics","1491","711","830","827","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics - Space Physics"],"title":"From Sun to Interplanetary Space: What is the Pathlength of Solar Energetic Particles?","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne **Two** Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

SEP propagation is influenced by turbulent magnetic fields in the solar wind, resulting in stochastic transport of the particles from their acceleration site to Earth. While the conventional approach for SEP modelling focuses mainly on the transport of particles along the mean Parker spiral magnetic field, multi- spacecraft observations suggest that the cross-field propagation shapes the SEP fluxes at Earth strongly. However, adding cross- field transport of SEPs as spatial diffusion has been shown to be insufficient in modelling the SEP events without use of unrealistically large cross-field diffusion coefficients. Recently, Laitinen et al. [ApJL 773 (2013b); A\u0026A 591 (2016)] demonstrated that the early-time propagation of energetic particles across the mean field direction in turbulent fields is not diffusive, with the particles propagating along meandering field lines. This early-time transport mode results in fast access of the particles across the mean field direction, in agreement with the SEP observations. In this work, we study the propagation of SEPs within the new transport paradigm, and demonstrate the significance of turbulence strength on the evolution of the SEP radiation environment near Earth. We calculate the transport parameters consistently using a turbulence transport model, parametrised by the SEP parallel scattering mean free path at 1 AU, ensuremathłambda$_ensuremath∥$$^*$, and show that the parallel and cross-field transport are connected, with conditions resulting in slow parallel transport corresponding to wider events. We find a scaling ensuremaths igma$_ensuremathǎrphi,max$ensuremath∝(1/ ensuremathłambda$_ensuremath∥$$^*$)$^1/4$ for the Gaussian fitting of the longitudinal distribution of maximum intensities. The longitudes with highest intensities are shifted towards the west for strong scattering conditions. Our results emphasise the importance of understanding both the SEP transport and the interplanetary turbulence conditions for modelling and predicting the SEP radiation environment at Earth.","tags":["Cosmic rays","diffusion","Sun: heliosphere","Sun: particle emission","turbulence","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics - Space Physics"],"title":"The effect of turbulence strength on meandering field lines and Solar Energetic Particle event extents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Recently, it has been suggested that initially the particles propagate systematically along meandering field lines, and only later reach the time-asymptotic diffusive cross-field propagation. In this paper, we analyse cross-field propagation of 1-100 MeV protons in composite 2D-slab turbulence superposed on a constant background magnetic field, using full-orbit particle simulations, to study the non-diffusive phase of particle propagation with a wide range of turbulence parameters. We show that the early-time non-diffusive propagation of the particles is consistent with particle propagation along turbulently meandering field lines. This results in a wide cross-field extent of the particles already at the initial arrival of particles to a given distance along the mean field direction, unlike when using spatial diffusion particle transport models. The cross-field extent of the particle distribution remains constant for up to tens of hours in turbulence environment consistent with the inner heliosphere during solar energetic particle events. Subsequently, the particles escape from their initial meandering field lines, and the particle propagation across the mean field reaches time- asymptotic diffusion. Our analysis shows that in order to understand solar energetic particle event origins, particle transport modelling must include non-diffusive particle propagation along meandering field lines.","tags":["diffusion","magnetic fields","turbulence","Sun: particle emission","Physics - Space Physics","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"title":"Early propagation of energetic particles across the mean field in turbulent plasmas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leon Kocharov","Silja Pohjolainen","Alexander Mishev","Mike J.

Analysis of a relativistic proton event is based on modeling of the particle transport and interaction, from a near-Sun source through the solar wind and the Earthtextquoterights magnetosphere and atmosphere to a detector on the ground. This allows us to deduce the time profile of the proton source at the Sun and compare it with observed electromagnetic emissions. The 1998 May 2 event is associated with a flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME), which were well observed by the Nançay Radioheliograph, thus the images of the radio sources are available. For the 2003 November 2 event, the low corona images of the CME liftoff obtained at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory are available. Those complementary data sets are analyzed jointly with the broadband dynamic radio spectra, EUV images, and other data available for both events. We find a common scenario for both eruptions, including the flaretextquoterights dual impulsive phase, the CME-launch-associated decimetric-continuum burst, and the late, low-frequency type III radio bursts at the time of the relativistic proton injection into the interplanetary medium. The analysis supports the idea that the two considered events start with emission of relativistic protons previously accelerated during the flare and CME launch, then trapped in large-scale magnetic loops and later released by the expanding CME.","tags":["acceleration of particles","shock waves","Sun: coronal mass ejections: CME","Sun: particle emission"],"title":"Investigating the Origins of Two Extreme Solar Particle Events: Proton Source Profile and Associated Electromagnetic Emissions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

The intensity profiles of iron and oxygen in Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events often display differences that result in a decreasing Fe/O ratio over time. The physical mechanisms behind this behaviour are not fully understood, but these observational signatures provide important tests of physical modelling efforts.  Aims: In this paper we study the propagation of iron and oxygen SEP ions using a 3D model of propagation which includes the effect of guiding centre drift in a Parker spiral magnetic field. We derive time intensity profiles for a variety of observer locations and study the temporal evolution of the Fe/O ratio.  Methods: We use a 3D full orbit test particle model which includes scattering. The configuration of the interplanetary magnetic field is a unipolar Parker spiral. Particles are released instantaneously from a compact region at two solar radii and allowed to propagate in 3D.  Results: Both Fe and O experience significant transport across the magnetic field due to gradient and curvature drifts. We find that Fe ions drift more than O ions due to their larger mass-to-charge ratio, so that an observer that is not magnetically well connected to the source region will observe Fe arriving before O, for particles within the same range in energy per nucleon. As a result, for the majority of observer locations, the Fe/O ratio displays a decrease in time.

However, recent studies suggest that at short timescales, such as soon after solar energetic particle (SEP) injection, particles remain on turbulently meandering field lines, which results in nondiffusive initial propagation across the mean magnetic field. In this work, we use a new technique to investigate how the particles are displaced from their original field lines, and we quantify the parameters of the transition from field-aligned particle propagation along meandering field lines to particle diffusion across the mean magnetic field. We show that the initial decoupling of the particles from the field lines is slow, and particles remain within a Larmor radius from their initial meandering field lines for tens to hundreds of Larmor periods, for 0.1-10 MeV protons in turbulence conditions typical of the solar wind at 1 au. Subsequently, particles decouple from their initial field lines and after hundreds to thousands of Larmor periods reach time-asymptotic diffusive behavior consistent with particle diffusion across the mean field caused by the meandering of the field lines. We show that the typical duration of the prediffusive phase, hours to tens of hours for 10 MeV protons in 1 au solar wind turbulence conditions, is significant for SEP propagation to 1 au and must be taken into account when modeling SEP propagation in the interplanetary space.","tags":["diffusion","magnetic fields","Sun: particle emission","turbulence","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics - Space Physics"],"title":"Energetic Particle Transport across the Mean Magnetic Field: Before Diffusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Current solar energetic particle (SEP) propagation models describe the effects of interplanetary plasma turbulence on SEPs as diffusion, using a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. However, FP models cannot explain the observed fast access of SEPs across the average magnetic field to regions that are widely separated in longitude within the heliosphere without using unrealistically strong cross-field diffusion.  Aims: We study whether the recently suggested early non- diffusive phase of SEP propagation can explain the wide SEP events with realistic particle transport parameters.  Methods: We used a novel model that accounts for the SEP propagation along field lines that meander as a result of plasma turbulence. Such a non-diffusive propagation mode has been shown to dominate the SEP cross-field propagation early in the SEP event history. We compare the new model to the traditional approach, and to SEP observations.  Results: Using the new model, we reproduce the observed longitudinal extent of SEP peak fluxes that are characterised by a Gaussian profile with ensuremathσ = 30-50°, while current diffusion theory can only explain extents of 11° with realistic diffusion coefficients. Our model also reproduces the timing of SEP arrival at distant longitudes, which cannot be explained using the diffusion model.  Conclusions: The early onset of SEPs over a wide range of longitudes can be understood as a result of the effects of magnetic field-line random walk in the interplanetary medium and requires an SEP transport model that properly describes the non-diffusive early phase of SEP cross- field propagation.","tags":["Sun: particle emission","turbulence","Sun: heliosphere","magnetic fields","diffusion","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics - Space Physics"],"title":"Solar energetic particle access to distant longitudes through turbulent field-line meandering","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

The calculations retain all three spatial variables describing particlestextquoteright trajectories, allowing us to model any transport across the magnetic field. Large energy change is shown to occur for protons, due to the combined effect of standard adiabatic deceleration and a significant contribution from particle drift in the direction opposite to that of the solar wind electric field. The latter drift-induced deceleration is found to have a stronger effect for SEP energies than for galactic cosmic rays. The kinetic energy of protons injected at 1 MeV is found to be reduced by between 35% and 90% after four days, and for protons injected at 100 MeV by between 20% and 55%. The overall degree of deceleration is a weak function of the scattering mean free path, showing that, although adiabatic deceleration plays a role, a large contribution is due to particle drift. Current SEP transport models are found to account for drift-induced deceleration in an approximate way and their accuracy will need to be assessed in future work.","tags":["magnetic fields","plasmas","Sun: activity","Sun: heliosphere","Sun: particle emission","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics - Space Physics"],"title":"Drift-induced Deceleration of Solar Energetic Particles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Traditionally the injection time is determined using the Velocity Dispersion Analysis (VDA) where a linear fit of the observed event onset times at 1 AU to the inverse velocities of SEPs is used to derive the injection time and path length of the first-arriving particles. VDA does not, however, take into account that the particles that produce a statistically observable onset at 1 AU have scattered in the interplanetary space. We use Monte Carlo test particle simulations of energetic protons to study the effect of particle scattering on the observable SEP event onset above pre-event background, and consequently on VDA results. We find that the VDA results are sensitive to the properties of the pre-event and event particle spectra as well as SEP injection and scattering parameters. In particular, a VDA-obtained path length that is close to the nominal Parker spiral length does not imply that the VDA injection time is correct. We study the delay to the observed onset caused by scattering of the particles and derive a simple estimate for the delay time by using the rate of intensity increase at the SEP onset as a parameter. We apply the correction to a magnetically well-connected SEP event of 2000 June 10, and show it to improve both the path length and injection time estimates, while also increasing the error limits to better reflect the inherent uncertainties of VDA.","tags":["diffusion","methods: data analysis","Sun: particle emission","turbulence","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics - Space Physics"],"title":"Correcting for Interplanetary Scattering in Velocity Dispersion analysis of Solar Energetic Particles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

Assuming the latter, we model a scenario in which particles are accelerated near the Sun in a shock wave with a fraction transported back to the solar surface to radiate, while the remainder is detected at Earth in the form of a GLE. Interplanetary ions versus ions interacting at the Sun are studied for a spherical shock wave propagating in a radial magnetic field through a highly turbulent radial ray (the acceleration core) and surrounding weakly turbulent sector in which the accelerated particles can propagate toward or away from the Sun. The model presented here accounts for both the first-order Fermi acceleration at the shock front and the second-order, stochastic re-acceleration by the turbulence enhanced behind the shock. We find that the re-acceleration is important in generating the ensuremathγ-radiation and we also find that up to 10% of the particle population can find its way to the Sun as compared to particles escaping to the interplanetary space.","tags":["acceleration of particles","plasmas","shock waves","Sun: coronal mass ejections: CMEs","Sun: particle emission","turbulence"],"title":"Solar Interacting Protons Versus Interplanetary Protons in the Core Plus Halo Model of Diffusive Shock Acceleration and Stochastic Re-acceleration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

We present a new flexible modeling system simulating the propagation of Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) from locations near the Sun to any given location in the heliosphere to forecast the SEP flux profiles. Solar Particle Radiation SWx (SPARX) uses an innovative methodology that allows implementation within an operational framework to overcome the time constraints of test particle modeling of SEP profiles, allowing the production of near-real- time SEP nowcasts and forecasts, when paired with appropriate near-real-time triggers. SPARX has the capability to produce SEP forecasts within minutes of being triggered by observations of a solar eruptive event. The model is based on the test particle approach and is spatially 3-D, thus allowing for the possibility of transport in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. The model naturally includes the effects of perpendicular propagation due to drifts and drift-induced deceleration. The modeling framework and the way in which parameters of relevance for Space Weather forecasting are obtained are described. The first results from the modeling system are presented. These results demonstrate that corotation and drift of SEP streams play an important role in shaping SEP flux profiles.","tags":["solar","particles","forecasting","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"title":"SPARX: A modeling system for Solar Energetic Particle Radiation Space Weather forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Solar electromagnetic emissions, including nuclear gamma-rays, suggest that high-energy ions could also be accelerated by coronal shocks, and some of those particles could contribute to SEPs in interplanetary space. However, the CME-driven shock in solar wind is thought to shield any particle source beneath the shock because of the strong scattering required for the diffusive shock acceleration. In this Letter, we consider a shock model that allows energetic particles from the possible behind-shock source to appear in front of the shock simultaneously with SEPs accelerated by the shock itself. We model the energetic particle transport in directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field in a spherical shock expanding through the highly turbulent magnetic sector with an embedded quiet magnetic tube, which makes the shock semi-transparent for energetic particles. The model energy spectra and time profiles of energetic ions escaping far upstream of the shock are similar to the profiles observed during the first hour of some gradual SEP events.","tags":["acceleration of particles","shock waves","Sun: corona","Sun: coronal mass ejections: CMEs","Sun: flares","Sun: particle emission"],"title":"Transmission and Emission of Solar Energetic Particles in Semi-transparent Shocks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rami Vainio","Arttu Pönni","Markus Battarbee","Hannu E.

Parameters of the model are re-calibrated using a fully time-dependent self-consistent simulation model of the coupled particle acceleration and Alfvén-wave generation upstream of the shock. Our results show that analytical estimates of the cut-off energy resulting from the simplified theory and frequently used in SEP modelling are overestimating the cut-off momentum at the shock by one order magnitude. We show also that the cut-off momentum observed remotely far upstream of the shock (e.g., at 1 AU) can be used to infer the properties of the foreshock and the resulting energetic storm particle (ESP) event, when the shock is still at small distances from the Sun, unaccessible to the in-situ observations. Our results can be used in ESP event modelling for future missions to the inner heliosphere, like the Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus as well as in developing acceleration models for SEP events in the solar corona.","tags":["Energetic particle","SEP","Shocks","Heliosphere","Interplanetary medium"],"title":"A semi-analytical foreshock model for energetic storm particle events inside 1 AU","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Diffusive shock acceleration in the solar corona can accelerate solar energetic particles to very high energies. Acceleration efficiency is increased by entrapment through self-generated waves, which is highly dependent on the amount of accelerated particles. This, in turn, is determined by the efficiency of particle injection into the acceleration process. Aims: We present an analysis of the injection efficiency at coronal shocks of varying obliquity. We assessed injection through reflection and downstream scattering, including the effect of a cross-shock potential. Both quasi-thermal and suprathermal seed populations were analysed. We present results on the effect of cross-field diffusion downstream of the shock on the injection efficiency. Methods: Using analytical methods, we present applicable injection speed thresholds that were compared with both semi-analytical flux integration and Monte Carlo simulations, which do not resort to binary thresholds. Shock-normal angle ensuremathþeta$_Bn$ and shock-normal velocity V$_s$ were varied to assess the injection efficiency with respect to these parameters. Results: We present evidence of a significant bias of thermal seed particle injection at small shock-normal angles. We show that downstream isotropisation methods affect the ensuremathþeta$_Bn$-dependence of this result. We show a non-negligible effect caused by the cross-shock potential, and that the effect of downstream cross- field diffusion is highly dependent on boundary definitions. Conclusions: Our results show that for Monte Carlo simulations of coronal shock acceleration a full distribution function assessment with downstream isotropisation through scatterings is necessary to realistically model particle injection. Based on our results, seed particle injection at quasi-parallel coronal shocks can result in significant acceleration efficiency, especially when combined with varying field-line geometry.

As a result, they have so far been ignored in SEP propagation modeling and data analysis. We examine drift velocities in the Parker spiral within single particle first-order adiabatic theory, in a local coordinate system with an axis parallel to the magnetic field. We show that, in the presence of scattering in interplanetary space, protons at the high end of the SEP energy range experience significant gradient and curvature drift. In the scatter-free case, drift due to magnetic field curvature is present. The magnitude of drift velocity increases by more than an order of magnitude at high heliographic latitudes compared to near the ecliptic; it has a strong dependence on radial distance r from the Sun, reaching a maximum at rensuremath∼1 AU at low heliolatitudes and rensuremath∼10 AU at high heliolatitudes. Due to the mass over charge dependence of drift velocities, the effect of drift for partially ionized SEP heavy ions is stronger than for protons. Drift is therefore likely to be a considerable source of cross-field transport for high- energy SEPs.","tags":["solar energetic particles","particle propagation","interplanetary magnetic field","drifts","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics - Space Physics"],"title":"Solar energetic particle drifts in the Parker spiral","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

However, the current paradigm of solar energetic particle (SEP) propagation holds the effects of drifts to be negligible, and they are not accounted for in most current SEP modeling efforts. We present full-orbit test particle simulations of SEP propagation in a Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), which demonstrate that high-energy particle drifts cause significant asymmetric propagation perpendicular to the IMF. Thus in many cases the assumption of field-aligned propagation of SEPs may not be valid. We show that SEP drifts have dependencies on energy, heliographic latitude, and charge-to-mass ratio that are capable of transporting energetic particles perpendicular to the field over significant distances within interplanetary space, e.g., protons of initial energy 100 MeV propagate distances across the field on the order of 1 AU, over timescales typical of a gradual SEP event. Our results demonstrate the need for current models of SEP events to include the effects of particle drift. We show that the drift is considerably stronger for heavy ion SEPs due to their larger mass-to-charge ratio. This paradigm shift has important consequences for the modeling of SEP events and is crucial to the understanding and interpretation of in situ observations.","tags":["solar wind","solar-terrestrial relations","stars: activity","Sun: activity","Sun: heliosphere","Sun: particle emission","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"title":"Drift-induced Perpendicular Transport of Solar Energetic Particles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

We use full-orbit simulations of a 10 MeV proton beam in a turbulent magnetic field to study to what extent the spread across the mean field can be described as diffusion early in a particle event. We compare the full- orbit code results to solutions of a Fokker-Planck equation including spatial and pitch angle diffusion, and of one including also propagation of the particles along random-walking magnetic field lines. We find that propagation of the particles along meandering field lines is the key process determining their cross-field spread at 1 AU at the beginning of the simulated event. The mean square displacement of the particles an hour after injection is an order of magnitude larger than that given by the diffusion model, indicating that models employing spatial cross-field diffusion cannot be used to describe early evolution of an SEP event. On the other hand, the diffusion of the particles from their initial field lines is negligible during the first 5 hr, which is consistent with the observations of SEP intensity dropouts. We conclude that modeling SEP events must take into account the particle propagation along meandering field lines for the first 20 hr of the event.","tags":["diffusion","magnetic fields","Sun: particle emission","turbulence","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics - Space Physics"],"title":"Energetic Particle Cross-field Propagation Early in a Solar Event","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

This causes instabilities, which lead to wave growth at specific resonant wave numbers, especially within shock regions. These amplified wave modes influence the turbulent scattering process significantly. In this paper, results of particle transport and scattering in turbulent plasmas with excited wave modes are presented. The method used is a hybrid simulation code, which treats the heliospheric turbulence by an incompressible magnetohydrodynamic approach separately from a kinetic particle description. Furthermore, a semi-analytical model using quasilinear theory (QLT) is compared to the numerical results. This paper aims at a more fundamental understanding and interpretation of the pitch- angle scattering coefficients. Our calculations show a good agreement of particle simulations and the QLT for broad-band turbulent spectra; for higher turbulence levels and particle beam driven plasmas, the QLT approximation gets worse. Especially the resonance gap at ensuremathμ = 0 poses a well-known problem for QLT for steep turbulence spectra, whereas test-particle computations show no problems for the particles to scatter across this region. The reason is that the sharp resonant wave-particle interactions in QLT are an oversimplification of the broader resonances in test-particle calculations, which result from nonlinear effects not included in the QLT. We emphasise the importance of these results for both numerical simulations and analytical particle transport approaches, especially the validity of the QLT.

The turbulence evolution is, however, typically a nonlinear process, and, particularly in the heliospheric context, the solar wind plasma is inhomogeneous due to the transient structures, as observed by remote and in situ measurements. In this work, we study the effects of the inhomogeneities on energetic particle transport by using spatially distributed, superposed turbulence envelopes. We find that the cross-field transport is significantly reduced, when compared to the results obtained with homogeneous turbulence. The reduction can reach an order of magnitude when the enveloping breaks the wave phase coherence along the mean magnetic field direction.","tags":["cosmic rays","diffusion","turbulence","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"title":"Energetic Particle Diffusion in Structured Turbulence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Acceleration in coronal mass ejection driven shocks is currently considered the primary source of large solar energetic particle events. Aims. The solar wind, which feeds shock- accelerated particles, includes numerous ion populations, which offer much insight into acceleration processes. We present first simulations of shock-accelerated minor ions, in order to explore trapping dynamics and acceleration timescales in detail. Methods. We have simulated diffusive shock acceleration of minor ions ($^3$He$^2+$, $^4$He$^2+$, $^16$O$^6+$ and $^56$Fe$^14+$) and protons using a Monte Carlo method, where self-generated Alfvénic turbulence allows for repeated shock crossings and acceleration to high energies. Results. We present the effect of minor ions on wave generation, especially at low wavenumbers, and show that it is significant. We find that maximum ion energy is determined by the competing effects of particle escape due to focusing in an expanding flux tube and trapping due to the amplified turbulence. We show the dependence of cut-off energy on the particle charge to mass ratio to be approximately (Q/A)$^1.5$. Conclusions. We suggest that understanding the acceleration of minor ions at coronal shocks requires simulations which allow us to explore trapping dynamics and acceleration timescales in detail, including evolution of the turbulent trapping boundary. We conclude that steady-state models do not adequately describe the acceleration of heavy ions in coronal shocks.","tags":["acceleration of particles","turbulence","Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs)","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics - Space Physics"],"title":"Heavy-ion acceleration and self-generated waves in coronal shocks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

While the model parameters are mainly determined using the B/C ratio, the study of extended sets of ratios can provide stronger constraints on the propagation models.

The secondary-to- primary ratios Li/C, Be/C, and B/C have been measured in the kinetic energy range 0.35-45 GeV nucleon$^-1$. The isotopic ratio $^7$Li/$^6$Li is also determined in the magnetic rigidity interval 2.5-6.3 GV. The secondary-to-secondary ratios Li/Be, Li/B, and Be/B are also reported. These measurements are based on the data collected by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer AMS-01 during the STS-91 space shuttle flight in 1998 June. Our experimental results are in substantial agreement with other measurements, where they exist. We describe our light-nuclei data with a diffusive-reacceleration model.

The model is based on a Monte Carlo method, where particles are traced in prescribed large-scale electromagnetic fields utilizing the guiding center approximation. The particles are scattered in the turbulence according to quasilinear theory, with the scattering amplitude directly proportional to the intensity of Alfvén waves at gyro-resonant wavenumbers. The Alfvén waves are traced simultaneously with the particles, so that the wave field is propagated outwards from the Sun using WKB propagation supplemented with a phenomenological wavenumber diffusion term and a growth rate computed from the net flux of the accelerated particles. We consider initial wave amplitudes small enough to allow rapid escape of particles from the shock to the ambient medium. Thus, in our model the Alfvén waves responsible for the diffusive acceleration of particles are generated by the accelerated particles themselves. In this work, we study the effects of non-constant shock velocity and non- monotonic Alfvén velocity on particle acceleration scenarios. We report in particular how the deceleration of a shock affects particle intensity and turbulence power evolution in the vicinity of the shock.","tags":["solar corona","magnetohydrodynamics","solar wind","shock waves","96.60.ph","95.30.Qd","96.60.Vg","96.50.Fm","Coronal mass ejection","Magnetohydrodynamics and plasmas","Particle emission solar wind","Planetary bow shocks","interplanetary shocks","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics - Space Physics"],"title":"Acceleration of Energetic Particles Through Self-Generated Waves in a Decelerating Coronal Shock","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

This approach has been studied by using energetic particle simulations, in order to understand the effect of the interplanetary scattering on the arrival time of the first particles to 1 AU. In these studies, the SEP event onset at 1 AU has been defined as the time when the intensities reach certain percentage of the maximum of the event. This is often not feasible for practical work, as a real event may be complex in its structure, and the pre-event background may mask the SEP onset to differing degrees in different energies. In order to estimate the usability of the VDA method, we study the simulated SEP onset on a pre-existing particle background by varying the pre-event background level, the difference of the pre-event background and the simulated event maximum spectral indices, the interplanetary mean free path and the injection profile. As in the previous studies, we find that large path length variation can be explained as an artifact resulting from the use of the VDA method. More importantly, the error in the obtained solar onset time depends strongly on the properties of the pre-event background.","tags":["energy states","turbulence","magnetic field effects","interplanetary matter","sensors","96.50.Vg","94.05.Lk","96.60.Hv","96.50.Ci","95.55.Rg","Energetic particles","Turbulence","Electric and magnetic fields solar magnetism","Solar wind plasma","sources of solar wind","Photoconductors and bolometers"],"title":"On the Effect of Pre-event Background in Determining Solar Particle Event Onset","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Analysis of the high-precision measurements of the åisebox-0.5ex~20 MeV proton flux anisotropy, model fitting of the type II dynamic spectrum, and SEP transport modeling support the idea that the shock wave of the first CME was an efficient accelerator for i̊sebox-0.5ex~20 MeV protons during only the first 6 hr after the launch. This shock gradually slowed down, weakened, and became transparent for the protons produced by the second eruption behind the previous CME. The main production of SEPs due to the two successive eruptions continued together for 12 hr. The near-Earth SEP event was additionally amplified by the SEP mirroring in the interplanetary magnetic field draping at the edge of an old CME beyond the Earth's orbit, which made the SEP intensity-time profiles more prolonged than would be expected based on the assumption of SEP transport in the standard solar wind.","tags":["acceleration of particles","shock waves","Sun: particle emission"],"title":"Gradual Solar Energetic Particle Event Associated with a Decelerating Shock Wave","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert F.

The results indicate that the accelerated particles amplify ambient Alfvén waves efficiently and that the solution close to the shock can be qualitatively described with the results from quasi-steady theories of diffusive shock acceleration, provided that the acceleration and injection parameters do not change rapidly. The escape of the first particles to the interplanetary medium occurs before the waves have grown appreciably to trap the particles in the vicinity of the shock wave. The escape process is well described by the analytical model developed by Vainio, at least for the promptly escaping component. In addition to the compression ratio and speed of the shock wave, the rate of injection of low-energy particles to the acceleration process is a key factor for the acceleration efficiency of shocks that are driven by coronal mass ejection. Quasi-parallel coronal shocks seem to be capable of accelerating suprathermal protons up to 100 MeV and beyond after some number of minutes. Extrapolations of our simulation results indicate, however, that the wave intensities may reach nonlinear values before acceleration to GeV energies occurs in the corona. This may mean that the quasi-linear approach has to be replaced by a more general theory to describe particle acceleration at quasi- parallel coronal shocks in the largest SEP events.","tags":["Acceleration of Particles","Shock Waves","Sun: Particle Emission","Turbulence"],"title":"Monte Carlo Simulations of Coronal Diffusive Shock Acceleration in Self-generated Turbulence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

If the release times of protons and helium nuclei do not overlap within their error limits, and if protons are released earlier than helium, then the helium event is defined as ``delayed''. Seventeen helium events (68%) were found to be ``delayed'' and only eight (32%) ``non-delayed''. The average delay was (34 ensuremath± 18) minutes. The event-related flare location had an important role in the ``non-delayed'' events. A significant difference was found in the helium-to- proton ratios at the time of maximum intensity of the ``delayed'' and ``non-delayed'' events. No clear evidence was found that the ``delayed'' and ``non-delayed'' events would correspond the classical gradual-impulsive division of SEP events. We find that the delay is related to the poor magnetic connection between the flare site and the spacecraft.","tags":["acceleration of particles","methods: data analysis","Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs)"],"title":"Proton and helium release times in SEP events observed with SOHO/ERNE","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Coronal shocks seem to be the most plausible candidate for the post-impulsive phase acceleration, which emits åisebox-0.5ex~1-100 MeV protons into the interplanetary medium for about 1 hr after the flare. We have employed a Monte Carlo technique to model the diffusive shock acceleration of protons in a turbulent layer at the base of the solar wind. We find that a power-law spectrum of energetic protons can be emitted from the trailing turbulent layer left behind the shock into the solar wind for a few tens of minutes after the CME liftoff. In contrast to an earlier expectation, the propagation direction of the shock wave is found not to be crucial. Both outward-propagating and refracting shocks can load the corona with energetic protons. Those protons escape into the interplanetary medium well after the passage of the shock. We have studied successive transformations of the particle spectra during shock acceleration, coronal transport, and possible reacceleration, for different populations of seed particles. The simulated production time profiles and energy spectra are found to be consistent with observations of the 1996 July 9 event by the Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron (ERNE) instrument on board SOHO. The new model can be easily combined with our previous interplanetary transport models, forming a basis on which to interpret SEP observations made at 1 AU.","tags":["Acceleration of Particles","Sun: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)","Sun: Flares","Sun: Particle Emission"],"title":"Modeling the Shock Aftermath Source of Energetic Particles in the Solar Corona","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

In order to model the latter consistently, we must consider the evolution of cross-helicity when modeling the strength of the cascade, as the non-linear interactions causing it require counterstreaming waves. In this paper, we present a simple model of non-WKB wave reflection from large-scale gradients, and apply the resulting cross-helicity to evaluate the evolution of the turbulence spectrum up to 0.3,AU by using a phenomenological cascade model. The study is restricted to a cascade in perpendicular direction. We study the ability of this spectral flux to heat the solar wind, and its dependence on the frequency of the excited waves. We find that the cascade, and, subsequently the heating, is considerably stronger than the one obtained by using ad-hoc modeling of the heating rates. The heating rate is also found to increase very fast toward the Sun, unlike the heating rates used in solar wind models capable of producing reasonable solar wind profiles.","tags":[],"title":"A Simple Model for Reflection-Driven Spectral Evolution of Turbulence in the Corona and Inner Heliosphere","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Thus, their observation could provide valuable clues for the actual evolution of the wave power close to the coronal base and, in turn, give constraints for solar wind modeling. Pursuing this idea, we have developed a steady- state two-fluid model for the wave heating and acceleration of the solar wind. The dissipation frequency determining the heating is obtained from a cyclotron damping rate that depends on the plasma beta and, thus, differs from the usual assumption, a fixed fraction of the ion cyclotron frequency.

We assume that there is sufficient wave power in the ion-cyclotron frequency range and determine the resulting acceleration and heating rates of the thermal plasma in the corona and interplanetary space. In improvement of earlier models of the nonlocal dynamics of the expanding corona, the dissipation frequency is determined self-consistently from the ion-cyclotron damping rate.

The level of fluctuations is however limited by energetic particle observations. The simplest cyclotron sweep models result in convection-dominated transport, contradicting observations. However, models incorporating wave-wave -interactions, which cause wave energy to cascade in wavenumber, allow more reasonable energetic particle transport in the interplanetary space. The mean free path of the energetic particles remains still relatively short in the corona, providing favorable conditions for coronal mass ejection (CME) related shock acceleration. We study the consequences of this scenario on the energetic particle production related to CMEs. The role of self-generated waves is also discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Shock acceleration of energetic particles in wave heated corona","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timo Laitinen"],"categories":["Invited workshop talk"],"content":"","date":1041379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669287808,"objectID":"b4e723786de24fb79302731d1c3dc3b6","permalink":"https://tlml.github.io/invited/laitinen-2003-ucrjet/","publishdate":"2022-11-24T12:09:42.275996Z","relpermalink":"/invited/laitinen-2003-ucrjet/","section":"invited","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Solar wind turbulence and SEPs","type":"invited"},{"authors":["E.

An upper limit on the flux ratio of antihelium to helium of \u003c1.1×10$^-6$ was obtained. The high energy proton, electron, positron, helium, antiproton and deuterium spectra were accurately measured. For each particle and nuclei two distinct spectra were observed: a higher energy spectrum and a substantial second spectrum. Positrons in the second spectrum were found to be much more abundant than electrons. Tracing particles from the second spectra shows that most of them travel for an extended period of time in the geomagnetic field, and that the positive particles (p and e$^+$) and negative ones (e$^-$) originate from two complementary geographic regions. The second helium spectrum flux over the energy range 0.1-1.2GeV/nucleon was measured to be (6.3+/-0.9)×10$^-3$(m$^2$ssr)$^-1$.

In the simplest version of the model (cyclotron sweep model), the waves propagate without interacting until they hit a resonance with the plasma ions at distance, where the ion cyclotron frequency becomes comparable to the wave frequency. We calculate the energetic test-particle mean free path lambda in solar corona heated by this mechanism. The primary result of our study is that energetic particles are efficiently coupled to the high- frequency MHD waves and may, thus, provide important feed back to wave-heating models. Detailed calculations are presented for a solar-wind stream of intermediate speed driven by the cyclotron sweep mechanism applying an extended quasi-linear theory for the mean free path. A local maximum of lambda is located near r=2 R_ensuremathødot , but lambda is very small at distances close to the Sun ( r\u003c1.3 R_ensuremathødot ) helping the acceleration of particles to high energies on open coronal field lines there. Another minimum for the mean free path is obtained near r=10 R_ensuremathødot enabling ion acceleration beyond 10 MeV/n in streams of intermediate speeds by CME shock waves in the test-particle approximation. However, the presence of high- frequency Alfvén waves in amounts required for the cyclotron sweep heating has to be limited below åisebox-0.5ex~ 10 R$_sun$ on field lines close to the ecliptic to avoid discrepancies with the inferred arrival times of solar energetic particles. Non-linear effects are discussed as a possible mechanism for removing the wave excess from the plasma.","tags":["SUN: CORONA","SUN: PARTICLE EMISSION","SOLAR WIND"],"title":"The relation between cyclotron heating and energetic particles on open coronal field lines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timo Laitinen","Rami Vainio"],"categories":["Workshop talk"],"content":"","date":978307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669292058,"objectID":"f181dc814d39b6efbfc39c001f3fa5ec","permalink":"https://tlml.github.io/contributed_presentations/laitinen-2001-platon-workshop-1/","publishdate":"2022-11-24T12:14:15.198736Z","relpermalink":"/contributed_presentations/laitinen-2001-platon-workshop-1/","section":"contributed_presentations","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The relation between cyclotron heating and SEP acceleration on open coronal field lines","type":"contributed_presentations"},{"authors":["AMS Collaboration","J.

This event is associated with an impulsive soft X-ray flare (9:10 UT) and a coronal mass ejection (CME). In a global classification the event is considered as mixed- impulsive. A sequence of acceleration processes is identified, starting early in the flare impulsive phase and continuing throughout the period when the CME propagated up to several R$_solar$ above the photosphere: (1) Gamma-ray, hard X-ray and cm-wave emitting particles seen during the flare impulsive phase in the low corona had no counterpart at the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) spacecraft. (2) Electrons accelerated at a coronal shock wave were revealed by decimetric- to-metric type II radio emission and by simultaneous radio signatures of beams traveling to 1 AU. (3) Mildly relativistic (\u003e=250 keV) electrons detected by SoHO did not correspond to these shock-accelerated populations, but to later mainly impulsive injection which was associated with radio brightenings over a large range of coronal altitudes. (4) Energetic protons detected by SoHO were accelerated during about 100 min after the flare impulsive phase with a gradually evolving production profile that bore some similarity with the time profile of broadband metric (type IV) emission. (5) While all other particle signatures decayed, a second period of interplanetary proton production took place \u003e=2 hours after flare onset. The first, 100 min period of SEP acceleration, post-impulsive phase coronal acceleration, is definitely dominant in mildly relativistic electrons. Two acceleration periods nearly equally contribute to the production of åisebox-0.5ex~ 20 MeV protons. However, the second period is more productive in low energy, i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 1 MeV, protons. The timing of the SEP injections indicates that neither the impulsive flare acceleration in the low corona nor the interplanetary CME at \u003e= 10 R$_solar$ are the main sources of the high-energy particles observed onboard SoHO. We suggest that various acceleration processes related to the reconfiguration of the corona in the course of the flare and CME lift-off contribute to the interacting and escaping particle populations, with different signatures at different energies and in different species.","tags":["SUN: CORONA","SUN: FLARES","SUN: PARTICLE EMISSION"],"title":"Solar energetic particle event and radio bursts associated with the 1996 July 9 flare and coronal mass ejection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

All events were associated with impulsive soft X-ray flares, Type II radio bursts and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Most attention is concentrated on the SEP acceleration during the first 100 minutes after the flare impulsive phase, post-impulsive-phase acceleration, being observed in eruptions centered at different solar longitudes. As a representative pattern of a (nearly) well-connected event, we consider the west flare and CME of 9 July 1996 (S10 W30). Similarities and dissimilarities of the post-impulsive-phase acceleration at large heliocentric-angle distance from the eruption center are illustrated with the 24 September 1997 event (S31 E19). We conclude that the proton acceleration at intermediate scales, between flare acceleration and interplanetary CME-driven shock acceleration, significantly contributes to the production of ensuremathgtrsim10 MeV protons.

The impact of diverging coronal magnetic field lines is incorporated into the particle transport operator and shown to be unavoidable, no matter how small the mean free path may be. We calculate the energy spectra of protons precipitating into the subcoronal regions (interacting protons) and the spectra of protons escaping into the interplanetary medium (interplanetary protons). In the case in which both injection and the magnetic field exponentially decrease with altitude, the proton spectra for interacting particles are steeper than the corresponding spectra in interplanetary space. The deduced high-energy ratio ensuremathΓ varies from 1 to åisebox-0.5ex~5, being almost independent on a magnetic mirror ratio beneath the acceleration region if the latter ratio does not exceed typically i̊sebox-0.5ex~10. A quantitative relation between the interplanetary to interacting proton ratio and the magnetic field change from the top of the interaction region to the top of the acceleration region is established. The model results are qualitatively consistent with patterns of energetic protons, ensuremathγ-rays, and neutrons produced during the approximately 40 minutes after the impulsive phase of the 1990 May 24 solar flare.","tags":["SUN: CORONA","SUN: FLARES","SUN: MAGNETIC FIELDS","SUN: PARTICLE EMISSION","SUN: X-RAYS","GAMMA RAYS","Sun: Corona","Sun: Flares","Sun: Magnetic Fields","Sun: Particle Emission","Sun: X-Rays","Gamma Rays"],"title":"Interacting and Interplanetary Protons Accelerated on Diverging Magnetic Field Lines: Stochastic Acceleration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

The LASCO CME observations, the presence of AR 7981 beyond the west limb, and type II and IV radio burst timing with respect to the proton event onset indicate that the parent solar eruption may be centered on the back side of the Sun, at åisebox-0.5ex~150°W. In such a case, expanding CME-associated wave can reach the Earth- connected interplanetary magnetic field line in i̊sebox-0.5ex~1 hour and so give rise to the \u003e10-MeV proton event observed with the Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron (ERNE) instrument onboard SOHO. We verify this hypothesis against observational data and conclude that a solar back side eruption is the most plausible explanation of the August 13, 1996, event. We compare the August 13, 1996, event with events associated with Earth directed CMEs and show that the August 13, 1996, event reveals many properties common to \u003e10-MeV proton events originating from solar eruptions centered rs̊ebox-0.5ex~90° away from the root of the Earth-connected interplanetary magnetic field line. In such events, the first detected protons are released rae̊box-0.5ex~1 hour after the start time of type II and IV radio bursts. The first injection spectrum is essentially harder than the spectrum at the intensity maximum; that is, the hard but less intensive proton production is followed by the major soft-spectrum production when CME expands farther from the Sun.","tags":["Solar Physics","Astrophysics","and Astronomy: Energetic particles"],"title":"Energetic (åisebox-0.5ex~10-65 MeV) protons observed by ERNE on August 13-14, 1996: Eruption on the solar back side as a possible source of the event","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timo Laitinen"],"categories":["Poster"],"content":"","date":883612800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669292066,"objectID":"1df9e561b9a29234e06a13847aac957c","permalink":"https://tlml.github.io/contributed_presentations/laitinen-1998-ams-poster/","publishdate":"2022-11-24T12:14:22.78291Z","relpermalink":"/contributed_presentations/laitinen-1998-ams-poster/","section":"contributed_presentations","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"AMS:n sukkulalento","type":"contributed_presentations"},{"authors":["J.

However, the magnitudes of energetic proton events differed dramatically on different occasions. In strong proton events, production of 10-50 MeV protons started during expansion of the coronal Moreton wave in the western hemisphere of the Sun.

High-energy protons were detected by the ERNE instrument on board SOHO. Anisotropy of arriving protons revealed very peculiar non-monotonic development. A short period of almost isotropic distribution was imbedded into the prolonged period of beam-like distribution of 14 17 MeV protons. This implies the existence of a narrow magnetic channel with a much smaller mean free path than in the surrounding quiet solar wind plasma. We used Monte Carlo simulations of interplanetary transport to fit the observed anisotropies and intensity time profiles. Proton injection and transport parameters are estimated. The injection scenario is found to be very close to the scenario of the 24 May 1990 event, but the intensity and the interplanetary transport parameters are different. The extreme anisotropy observed implies prolonged injection of high-energy protons at the Sun and at the interplanetary shock front, and either a very large mean free path (ensuremath≥ 5 AU) outside the slow transport channel, or alternatively, a somewhat smaller mean free path (ensuremath≈2 AU) and enhanced focusing between the Sun and the Earth.","tags":[],"title":"Implications of Proton Anisotropy Development Observed by the ERNE Instrument During the 9 July 1996 Solar Particle Event","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

The arrival of the first protons in the energy range \u003e20 MeV took place at 09:55 UT, 43 min after the maximum in the X-ray and Hensuremathα radiation of a flare located at S10 W30. The rise phase of the particle intensities at all energies was exceptionally rapid. At 12:50 UT, the intensities dropped in all energy channels. Simultaneously, the magnetic field instrument MFI on board WIND, not far from SOHO, detected a sharp and large change in the magnetic field direction. The analysis of the directional measurements of ERNE in the energy range 14 17 MeV shows the presence of a strong flux anisotropy during the whole period 10:10 12:50 UT. From 12:50 UT until about 16:00 UT, the directional analysis of the proton fluxes gives only a weak anisotropy at the limit of the sensor resolution. Later on, the flux anisotropy was found to recur, indicating a continuous injection of particles into the flux tubes connected to the SOHO spacecraft. These experimental results lead to strict limits on particle injection and transport models. The first period of the anisotropy and its recurrent phase cover 24 hours. This suggests an extended injection of particles. The strength and stability of the anisotropy indicate that, during these periods, SOHO was in an interplanetary sector where the particle transport was almost scatter-free. On the other hand, during the intermediate 3-hr period, we observed particles which traveled in a sector of diffusive transport or which were retarded by magnetic field disturbances not far from the observation site.","tags":[],"title":"Recurrence of Energetic Particle Flux Anisotropy as Observed by ERNE on 9 July 1996","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

The main period under study is from the beginning of May till mid-October 1996. Only very small energetic particle events were observed. A comparison of the ERNE measurements with energetic particle observations during the two previous solar minima indicates that the flux levels of protons during the first half of 1996 are exceptionally low. The daily counting rates of quiet-time protons and 4̂He in the energy range 13-100 MeV/nucleon show statistically significant variations with time. Following two energetic particle events in July and August, anticorrelations were found between enhancements of low energy protons in the range 1.5-8 MeV, possibly accelerated in a corotating interaction region, and the modulation of high energy protons and helium above 13 MeV/nucleon. The period of the observed anticorrelations coincide with the solar rotation period.","tags":["Soho Mission","Energetic Particles","Particle Flux Density","High Energy Electrons","Relativistic Particles","Solar Flux","Solar Rotation","Solar Protons","Solar Electrons","Space Radiation"],"title":"ERNE observations of energetic particle fluxes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.
