 abstract = {Context. The intensity profiles of iron and oxygen in Solar Energetic
Particle (SEP) events often display differences that result in a
decreasing Fe/O ratio over time. The physical mechanisms behind
this behaviour are not fully understood, but these observational
signatures provide important tests of physical modelling
efforts. \ Aims: In this paper we study the
propagation of iron and oxygen SEP ions using a 3D model of
propagation which includes the effect of guiding centre drift in
a Parker spiral magnetic field. We derive time intensity
profiles for a variety of observer locations and study the
temporal evolution of the Fe/O ratio. \ Methods: We
use a 3D full orbit test particle model which includes
scattering. The configuration of the interplanetary magnetic
field is a unipolar Parker spiral. Particles are released
instantaneously from a compact region at two solar radii and
allowed to propagate in 3D. \ Results: Both Fe and
O experience significant transport across the magnetic field due
to gradient and curvature drifts. We find that Fe ions drift
more than O ions due to their larger mass-to-charge ratio, so
that an observer that is not magnetically well connected to the
source region will observe Fe arriving before O, for particles
within the same range in energy per nucleon. As a result, for
the majority of observer locations, the Fe/O ratio displays a
decrease in time. \ Conclusions: We conclude that
propagation effects associated with drifts produce a decay over
time of the Fe/O ratio, qualitatively reproducing that observed
in SEP event profiles.},
