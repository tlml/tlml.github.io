 abstract = {The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) is designed as an independent
module for installation on the International Space Station (ISS)
in the year 2003 for an operational period of three years. The
principal scientific objectives include searches for antimatter
and dark matter in cosmic rays. The AMS tracker uses silicon
microstrip sensors to reconstruct charged-particle trajectories.
A first version of the AMS, equipped with 2.1 m$^2$ of silicon
sensors and a permanent magnet, was flown on the NASA space
shuttle Discovery during June 2 - 12, 1998. The authors describe
the detector and present results of the tracker performance
during the flight.},
