 abstract = {High-energy particles stream during coronal mass ejections or flares
through the plasma of the solar wind. This causes instabilities,
which lead to wave growth at specific resonant wave numbers,
especially within shock regions. These amplified wave modes
influence the turbulent scattering process significantly. In
this paper, results of particle transport and scattering in
turbulent plasmas with excited wave modes are presented. The
method used is a hybrid simulation code, which treats the
heliospheric turbulence by an incompressible magnetohydrodynamic
approach separately from a kinetic particle description.
Furthermore, a semi-analytical model using quasilinear theory
(QLT) is compared to the numerical results. This paper aims at a
more fundamental understanding and interpretation of the pitch-
angle scattering coefficients. Our calculations show a good
agreement of particle simulations and the QLT for broad-band
turbulent spectra; for higher turbulence levels and particle
beam driven plasmas, the QLT approximation gets worse.
Especially the resonance gap at \ensuremathÎ¼ = 0 poses a
well-known problem for QLT for steep turbulence spectra, whereas
test-particle computations show no problems for the particles to
scatter across this region. The reason is that the sharp
resonant wave-particle interactions in QLT are an
oversimplification of the broader resonances in test-particle
calculations, which result from nonlinear effects not included
in the QLT. We emphasise the importance of these results for
both numerical simulations and analytical particle transport
approaches, especially the validity of the QLT.
