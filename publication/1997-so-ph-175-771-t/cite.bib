 abstract = {A solar energetic particle event was observed on 9 July 1996, by the
ERNE sensors LED and HED on board the SOHO spacecraft. The
arrival of the first protons in the energy range >20 MeV took
place at 09:55 UT, 43 min after the maximum in the X-ray and
H\ensuremathÎ± radiation of a flare located at S10 W30.
The rise phase of the particle intensities at all energies was
exceptionally rapid. At 12:50 UT, the intensities dropped in all
energy channels. Simultaneously, the magnetic field instrument
MFI on board WIND, not far from SOHO, detected a sharp and large
change in the magnetic field direction. The analysis of the
directional measurements of ERNE in the energy range 14 17 MeV
shows the presence of a strong flux anisotropy during the whole
period 10:10 12:50 UT. From 12:50 UT until about 16:00 UT, the
directional analysis of the proton fluxes gives only a weak
anisotropy at the limit of the sensor resolution. Later on, the
flux anisotropy was found to recur, indicating a continuous
injection of particles into the flux tubes connected to the SOHO
spacecraft. These experimental results lead to strict limits on
particle injection and transport models. The first period of the
anisotropy and its recurrent phase cover 24 hours. This suggests
an extended injection of particles. The strength and stability
of the anisotropy indicate that, during these periods, SOHO was
in an interplanetary sector where the particle transport was
almost scatter-free. On the other hand, during the intermediate
3-hr period, we observed particles which traveled in a sector of
diffusive transport or which were retarded by magnetic field
disturbances not far from the observation site.},
