 abstract = {Context. Diffusive shock acceleration in the solar corona can accelerate
solar energetic particles to very high energies. Acceleration
efficiency is increased by entrapment through self-generated
waves, which is highly dependent on the amount of accelerated
particles. This, in turn, is determined by the efficiency of
particle injection into the acceleration process. \
Aims: We present an analysis of the injection efficiency at
coronal shocks of varying obliquity. We assessed injection
through reflection and downstream scattering, including the
effect of a cross-shock potential. Both quasi-thermal and
suprathermal seed populations were analysed. We present results
on the effect of cross-field diffusion downstream of the shock
on the injection efficiency. \ Methods: Using
analytical methods, we present applicable injection speed
thresholds that were compared with both semi-analytical flux
integration and Monte Carlo simulations, which do not resort to
binary thresholds. Shock-normal angle
\ensuremathþeta$_Bn$ and shock-normal velocity V$_s$
were varied to assess the injection efficiency with respect to
these parameters. \ Results: We present evidence of
a significant bias of thermal seed particle injection at small
shock-normal angles. We show that downstream isotropisation
methods affect the \ensuremathþeta$_Bn$-dependence of
this result. We show a non-negligible effect caused by the
cross-shock potential, and that the effect of downstream cross-
field diffusion is highly dependent on boundary definitions.
\ Conclusions: Our results show that for Monte
Carlo simulations of coronal shock acceleration a full
distribution function assessment with downstream isotropisation
through scatterings is necessary to realistically model particle
injection. Based on our results, seed particle injection at
quasi-parallel coronal shocks can result in significant
acceleration efficiency, especially when combined with varying
field-line geometry. \\Appendices are
