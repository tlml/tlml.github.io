 abstract = {We have developed a simulation model of particle acceleration in coronal
shock waves. The model is based on a Monte Carlo method, where
particles are traced in prescribed large-scale electromagnetic
fields utilizing the guiding center approximation. The particles
are scattered in the turbulence according to quasilinear theory,
with the scattering amplitude directly proportional to the
intensity of Alfvén waves at gyro-resonant wavenumbers. The
Alfvén waves are traced simultaneously with the particles,
so that the wave field is propagated outwards from the Sun using
WKB propagation supplemented with a phenomenological wavenumber
diffusion term and a growth rate computed from the net flux of
the accelerated particles. We consider initial wave amplitudes
small enough to allow rapid escape of particles from the shock
to the ambient medium. Thus, in our model the Alfvén waves
responsible for the diffusive acceleration of particles are
generated by the accelerated particles themselves. In this work,
we study the effects of non-constant shock velocity and non-
monotonic Alfvén velocity on particle acceleration
scenarios. We report in particular how the deceleration of a
shock affects particle intensity and turbulence power evolution
in the vicinity of the shock.},
