 abstract = {We report on Monte Carlo simulations of solar energetic particle (SEP)
acceleration at quasi-parallel coronal shocks under the
influence of self-generated Alfvén waves. The results
indicate that the accelerated particles amplify ambient
Alfvén waves efficiently and that the solution close to the
shock can be qualitatively described with the results from
quasi-steady theories of diffusive shock acceleration, provided
that the acceleration and injection parameters do not change
rapidly. The escape of the first particles to the interplanetary
medium occurs before the waves have grown appreciably to trap
the particles in the vicinity of the shock wave. The escape
process is well described by the analytical model developed by
Vainio, at least for the promptly escaping component. In
addition to the compression ratio and speed of the shock wave,
the rate of injection of low-energy particles to the
acceleration process is a key factor for the acceleration
efficiency of shocks that are driven by coronal mass ejection.
Quasi-parallel coronal shocks seem to be capable of accelerating
suprathermal protons up to 100 MeV and beyond after some number
of minutes. Extrapolations of our simulation results indicate,
however, that the wave intensities may reach nonlinear values
before acceleration to GeV energies occurs in the corona. This
may mean that the quasi-linear approach has to be replaced by a
more general theory to describe particle acceleration at quasi-
parallel coronal shocks in the largest SEP events.},
