 abstract = {We have constructed a semi-analytical model of the energetic-ion
foreshock of a CME-driven coronal/interplanetary shock wave
responsible for the acceleration of large solar energetic
particle (SEP) events. The model is based on the analytical
model of diffusive shock acceleration of Bell (1978), appended
with a temporal dependence of the cut-off momentum of the
energetic particles accelerated at the shock, derived from the
theory. Parameters of the model are re-calibrated using a fully
time-dependent self-consistent simulation model of the coupled
particle acceleration and Alfvén-wave generation upstream of
the shock. Our results show that analytical estimates of the
cut-off energy resulting from the simplified theory and
frequently used in SEP modelling are overestimating the cut-off
momentum at the shock by one order magnitude. We show also that
the cut-off momentum observed remotely far upstream of the shock
(e.g., at 1 AU) can be used to infer the properties of the
foreshock and the resulting energetic storm particle (ESP)
event, when the shock is still at small distances from the Sun,
unaccessible to the in-situ observations. Our results can be
used in ESP event modelling for future missions to the inner
heliosphere, like the Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus as well
as in developing acceleration models for SEP events in the solar
corona.},
