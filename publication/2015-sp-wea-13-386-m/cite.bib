 abstract = {The capability to predict the parameters of an SEP event such as its
onset, peak flux, and duration is critical to assessing any
potential space weather impact. We present a new flexible
modeling system simulating the propagation of Solar Energetic
Particles (SEPs) from locations near the Sun to any given
location in the heliosphere to forecast the SEP flux profiles.
Solar Particle Radiation SWx (SPARX) uses an innovative
methodology that allows implementation within an operational
framework to overcome the time constraints of test particle
modeling of SEP profiles, allowing the production of near-real-
time SEP nowcasts and forecasts, when paired with appropriate
near-real-time triggers. SPARX has the capability to produce SEP
forecasts within minutes of being triggered by observations of a
solar eruptive event. The model is based on the test particle
approach and is spatially 3-D, thus allowing for the possibility
of transport in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic
field. The model naturally includes the effects of perpendicular
propagation due to drifts and drift-induced deceleration. The
modeling framework and the way in which parameters of relevance
for Space Weather forecasting are obtained are described. The
first results from the modeling system are presented. These
results demonstrate that corotation and drift of SEP streams
play an important role in shaping SEP flux profiles.},
