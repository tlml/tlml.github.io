 abstract = {Context. Current solar energetic particle (SEP) propagation models
describe the effects of interplanetary plasma turbulence on SEPs
as diffusion, using a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. However, FP
models cannot explain the observed fast access of SEPs across
the average magnetic field to regions that are widely separated
in longitude within the heliosphere without using
unrealistically strong cross-field diffusion. \
Aims: We study whether the recently suggested early non-
diffusive phase of SEP propagation can explain the wide SEP
events with realistic particle transport parameters.
\ Methods: We used a novel model that accounts for
the SEP propagation along field lines that meander as a result
of plasma turbulence. Such a non-diffusive propagation mode has
been shown to dominate the SEP cross-field propagation early in
the SEP event history. We compare the new model to the
traditional approach, and to SEP observations. \
Results: Using the new model, we reproduce the observed
longitudinal extent of SEP peak fluxes that are characterised by
a Gaussian profile with \ensuremathσ =
30-50°, while current diffusion theory can only
explain extents of 11° with realistic diffusion
coefficients. Our model also reproduces the timing of SEP
arrival at distant longitudes, which cannot be explained using
the diffusion model. \ Conclusions: The early onset
of SEPs over a wide range of longitudes can be understood as a
result of the effects of magnetic field-line random walk in the
interplanetary medium and requires an SEP transport model that
properly describes the non-diffusive early phase of SEP cross-
field propagation.},
