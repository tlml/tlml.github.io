 abstract = {Wave damping and cascading processes have been found to be important for
the heating and acceleration of the solar wind. However, it
remains a difficult task to extract details of these processes
from observations of the thermal plasma only. The wave power
required for efficient heating and acceleration of the solar
wind also affects the acceleration and transport of solar
energetic particles. Thus, their observation could provide
valuable clues for the actual evolution of the wave power close
to the coronal base and, in turn, give constraints for solar
wind modeling. Pursuing this idea, we have developed a steady-
state two-fluid model for the wave heating and acceleration of
the solar wind. The dissipation frequency determining the
heating is obtained from a cyclotron damping rate that depends
on the plasma beta and, thus, differs from the usual assumption,
a fixed fraction of the ion cyclotron frequency. We present
first results obtained with the two-fluid code and, in
particular, discuss the implications of the corresponding mean
free path of energetic particles.},
