 abstract = {We analyze the relativistic proton emission from the Sun during the
eruptive event on 2017 September 10, which caused a ground-level
enhancement (GLE 72) registered by the worldwide network of
neutron monitors. Using the neutron monitor data and
interplanetary transport modeling both along and across
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) lines, we deduce parameters
of the proton injection into the interplanetary medium. The
inferred injection profile of the interplanetary protons is
compared with the profile of the >100 MeV
\ensuremathγ-ray emission observed by the Fermi Large
Area Telescope, attributed to pion production from the
interaction of >300 MeV protons at the Sun. GLE 72 started with
a prompt component that arrived along the IMF lines. This was
followed by a more prolonged enhancement caused by protons
arriving at the Earth across the IMF lines from the southwest.
The interplanetary proton event is modeled using two
sources—one source at the root of the Earth-
connected IMF line and another source situated near the solar
western limb. The maximum phase of the second injection of
interplanetary protons coincides with the maximum phase of the
prolonged >100 MeV \ensuremathγ-ray emission that
originated from a small area at the solar western limb, below
the current sheet trailing the associated coronal mass ejection
(CME). A possible common source of interacting protons and
interplanetary protons is discussed in terms of proton
acceleration at the CME bow shock versus coronal
(re-)acceleration in the wake of the CME.},
