 abstract = {Insights into the processes of Solar Energetic Particle (SEP)
propagation are essential for understanding how solar eruptions
affect the radiation environment of near-Earth space. SEP
propagation is influenced by turbulent magnetic fields in the
solar wind, resulting in stochastic transport of the particles
from their acceleration site to Earth. While the conventional
approach for SEP modelling focuses mainly on the transport of
particles along the mean Parker spiral magnetic field, multi-
spacecraft observations suggest that the cross-field propagation
shapes the SEP fluxes at Earth strongly. However, adding cross-
field transport of SEPs as spatial diffusion has been shown to
be insufficient in modelling the SEP events without use of
unrealistically large cross-field diffusion coefficients.
Recently, Laitinen et al. [ApJL 773 (2013b); A&A 591 (2016)]
demonstrated that the early-time propagation of energetic
particles across the mean field direction in turbulent fields is
not diffusive, with the particles propagating along meandering
field lines. This early-time transport mode results in fast
access of the particles across the mean field direction, in
agreement with the SEP observations. In this work, we study the
propagation of SEPs within the new transport paradigm, and
demonstrate the significance of turbulence strength on the
evolution of the SEP radiation environment near Earth. We
calculate the transport parameters consistently using a
turbulence transport model, parametrised by the SEP parallel
scattering mean free path at 1 AU,
\ensuremathłambda$_\ensuremath∥$$^*$, and
show that the parallel and cross-field transport are connected,
with conditions resulting in slow parallel transport
corresponding to wider events. We find a scaling \ensuremath\s
igma$_\ensuremathǎrphi,max$\ensuremath∝(1/\
ensuremathłambda$_\ensuremath∥$$^*$)$^1/4$
for the Gaussian fitting of the longitudinal distribution of
maximum intensities. The longitudes with highest intensities are
shifted towards the west for strong scattering conditions. Our
results emphasise the importance of understanding both the SEP
transport and the interplanetary turbulence conditions for
modelling and predicting the SEP radiation environment at Earth.},
