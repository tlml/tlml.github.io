 abstract = {We have studied statistically associations of moderate and intense
geomagnetic storms with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and
energetic particle events. The goal was to identify specific
energetic particle signatures, which could be used to improve
the predictions of the geoeffectiveness of full and partial halo
CMEs. Protons in the range 1-110 MeV from the ERNE experiment
onboard SOHO are used in the analysis. The study covers the time
period from August 1996 to July 2000. We demonstrate the
feasibility of energetic particle observations as an additional
source of information in evaluating the geoeffectiveness of full
and partial halo CMEs. Based on the observed onset times of
solar energetic particle (SEP) events and energetic storm
particle (ESP) events, we derive a proxy for the transit times
of shocks driven by the interplanetary counterparts of coronal
mass ejections from the Sun to the Earth. For a limited number
of geomagnetic storms which can be associated to both SEP and
ESP signatures, we found that this transit time correlates with
the strength of geomagnetic storms.},
