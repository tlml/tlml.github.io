 abstract = {We study the ratio of the numbers of interplanetary to interacting
protons, \ensuremathΓ, using a model of stochastic
acceleration on open magnetic field lines in solar corona. The
impact of diverging coronal magnetic field lines is incorporated
into the particle transport operator and shown to be
unavoidable, no matter how small the mean free path may be. We
calculate the energy spectra of protons precipitating into the
subcoronal regions (interacting protons) and the spectra of
protons escaping into the interplanetary medium (interplanetary
protons). In the case in which both injection and the magnetic
field exponentially decrease with altitude, the proton spectra
for interacting particles are steeper than the corresponding
spectra in interplanetary space. The deduced high-energy ratio
\ensuremathΓ varies from 1 to
åisebox-0.5ex~5, being almost independent on a
magnetic mirror ratio beneath the acceleration region if the
latter ratio does not exceed typically
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10. A quantitative relation
between the interplanetary to interacting proton ratio and the
magnetic field change from the top of the interaction region to
the top of the acceleration region is established. The model
results are qualitatively consistent with patterns of energetic
protons, \ensuremathγ-rays, and neutrons produced
during the approximately 40 minutes after the impulsive phase of
the 1990 May 24 solar flare.},
