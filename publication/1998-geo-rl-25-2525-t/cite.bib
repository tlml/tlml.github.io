 abstract = {During the period from January through mid-May, 1997, four large Earth-
directed CMEs were observed by the Large Angle Spectroscopic
Coronograph (LASCO). These CMEs were associated with long-
lasting fluxes of >1.6 MeV protons detected by the Energetic and
Relativistic Nuclei and Electron instrument (ERNE). However, the
magnitudes of energetic proton events differed dramatically on
different occasions. In strong proton events, production of
10-50 MeV protons started during expansion of the coronal
Moreton wave in the western hemisphere of the Sun. The new SOHO
observations suggest that potentialities of CMEs to produce
energetic particles in the interplanetary medium crucially
depend on the previous evolution of the explosion below
\ensuremath∼2R$_\ensuremathødot$. Forecasting of
the near-Earth >10 MeV proton intensity requires multiwavelength
observations of the early phase of an event particularly the
Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) observations.},
