 abstract = {We investigate the deceleration of solar energetic particles (SEPs)
during their propagation from the Sun through interplanetary
space, in the presence of weak to strong scattering in a Parker
spiral configuration, using relativistic full orbit test
particle simulations. The calculations retain all three spatial
variables describing particles\textquoteright trajectories,
allowing us to model any transport across the magnetic field.
Large energy change is shown to occur for protons, due to the
combined effect of standard adiabatic deceleration and a
significant contribution from particle drift in the direction
opposite to that of the solar wind electric field. The latter
drift-induced deceleration is found to have a stronger effect
for SEP energies than for galactic cosmic rays. The kinetic
energy of protons injected at 1 MeV is found to be reduced by
between 35% and 90% after four days, and for protons injected
at 100 MeV by between 20% and 55%. The overall degree of
deceleration is a weak function of the scattering mean free
path, showing that, although adiabatic deceleration plays a
role, a large contribution is due to particle drift. Current SEP
transport models are found to account for drift-induced
deceleration in an approximate way and their accuracy will need
to be assessed in future work.},
