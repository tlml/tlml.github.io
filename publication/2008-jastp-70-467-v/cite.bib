 abstract = {We have recently presented a numerical model to simulate the
acceleration and transport of energetic particles at coronal
shock waves, which includes the back-reaction of the energetic
particles on the Alfv√©n waves responsible for their
scattering in the ambient medium [Vainio, R., Laitinen, T.,
2007. Monte Carlo simulations of coronal diffusive shock
acceleration in self-generated turbulence. Astrophysical Journal
658, 622-630]. The model results imply that the acceleration of
energetic protons to energies exceeding 100 MeV can occur in
some minutes in parallel coronal shocks driven by fast CMEs. In
this paper we give a detailed description of the numerical model
and its foreseen extensions. We extend the parameter study
presented in the first paper to cover (shorter and) longer time
scales, and present the intensities observed in the
interplanetary medium during the initial phases of an SEP event.
We also study the scattering mean free path resulting from the
self-consistent computations. Finally, the potential of the
model to explain ion acceleration up to relativistic energies is
discussed.},
