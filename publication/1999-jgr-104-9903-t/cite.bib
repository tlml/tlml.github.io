 abstract = {The onset of the >10-MeV proton event of August 13-14, 1996, revealed a
velocity dispersion, which is a signature of its solar origin,
but no associated soft X ray flare was observed. The LASCO CME
observations, the presence of AR 7981 beyond the west limb, and
type II and IV radio burst timing with respect to the proton
event onset indicate that the parent solar eruption may be
centered on the back side of the Sun, at
åisebox-0.5ex~150°W. In such a
case, expanding CME-associated wave can reach the Earth-
connected interplanetary magnetic field line in
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~1 hour and so give rise to the
>10-MeV proton event observed with the Energetic and
Relativistic Nuclei and Electron (ERNE) instrument onboard SOHO.
We verify this hypothesis against observational data and
conclude that a solar back side eruption is the most plausible
explanation of the August 13, 1996, event. We compare the August
13, 1996, event with events associated with Earth directed CMEs
and show that the August 13, 1996, event reveals many properties
common to >10-MeV proton events originating from solar eruptions
centered \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~90° away
from the root of the Earth-connected interplanetary magnetic
field line. In such events, the first detected protons are
released \rae̊box-0.5ex~1 hour after the start
time of type II and IV radio bursts. The first injection
spectrum is essentially harder than the spectrum at the
intensity maximum; that is, the hard but less intensive proton
production is followed by the major soft-spectrum production
when CME expands farther from the Sun.},
