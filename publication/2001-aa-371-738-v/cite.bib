 abstract = {Cyclotron resonance with high-frequency Alfvén waves has been
proposed as an ion heating mechanism for producing high-speed
winds and large ion temperatures in coronal holes. In the
simplest version of the model (cyclotron sweep model), the waves
propagate without interacting until they hit a resonance with
the plasma ions at distance, where the ion cyclotron frequency
becomes comparable to the wave frequency. We calculate the
energetic test-particle mean free path lambda in solar corona
heated by this mechanism. The primary result of our study is
that energetic particles are efficiently coupled to the high-
frequency MHD waves and may, thus, provide important feed back
to wave-heating models. Detailed calculations are presented for
a solar-wind stream of intermediate speed driven by the
cyclotron sweep mechanism applying an extended quasi-linear
theory for the mean free path. A local maximum of lambda is
located near r=2 R_\ensuremathødot , but lambda is very
small at distances close to the Sun ( r<1.3
R_\ensuremathødot ) helping the acceleration of particles
to high energies on open coronal field lines there. Another
minimum for the mean free path is obtained near r=10
R_\ensuremathødot enabling ion acceleration beyond 10
MeV/n in streams of intermediate speeds by CME shock waves in
the test-particle approximation. However, the presence of high-
frequency Alfvén waves in amounts required for the cyclotron
sweep heating has to be limited below
åisebox-0.5ex~ 10 R$_sun$ on field lines
close to the ecliptic to avoid discrepancies with the inferred
arrival times of solar energetic particles. Non-linear effects
are discussed as a possible mechanism for removing the wave
excess from the plasma.},
