 abstract = {On 2000 April 4-6 the Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron
particle telescope on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
spacecraft observed a major solar energetic particle (SEP) event
associated with two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) separated by
approximately 8 hr. The first CME was accompanied by a low-
frequency type II radio burst observed by the WAVES receivers on
the Wind spacecraft. Analysis of the high-precision measurements
of the åisebox-0.5ex~20 MeV proton flux
anisotropy, model fitting of the type II dynamic spectrum, and
SEP transport modeling support the idea that the shock wave of
the first CME was an efficient accelerator for
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~20 MeV protons during only the
first 6 hr after the launch. This shock gradually slowed down,
weakened, and became transparent for the protons produced by the
second eruption behind the previous CME. The main production of
SEPs due to the two successive eruptions continued together for
12 hr. The near-Earth SEP event was additionally amplified by
the SEP mirroring in the interplanetary magnetic field draping
at the edge of an old CME beyond the Earth's orbit, which made
the SEP intensity-time profiles more prolonged than would be
expected based on the assumption of SEP transport in the
standard solar wind.},
