 abstract = {Solar energetic particles (SEPs), accelerated during solar eruptions,
propagate in turbulent solar wind before being observed with in
situ instruments. In order to interpret their origin through
comparison with remote sensing observations of the solar
eruption, we thus must deconvolve the transport effects due to
the turbulent magnetic fields from the SEP observations. Recent
research suggests that the SEP propagation is guided by the
turbulent meandering of the magnetic fieldlines across the mean
magnetic field. However, the lengthening of the distance the
SEPs travel, due to the fieldline meandering, has so far not
been included in SEP event analysis. This omission can cause
significant errors in estimation of the release times of SEPs at
the Sun. We investigate the distance traveled by the SEPs by
considering them to propagate along fieldlines that meander
around closed magnetic islands that are inherent in turbulent
plasma. We introduce a fieldline random walk model which takes
into account the physical scales associated to the magnetic
islands. Our method remedies the problem of the diffusion
equation resulting in unrealistically short pathlengths, and the
fractal dependence of the pathlength of random walk on the
length of the random-walk step. We find that the pathlength from
the Sun to 1 au can be below the nominal Parker spiral length
for SEP events taking place at solar longitudes 45E to 60W,
whereas the western and behind-the-limb particles can experience
pathlengths longer than 2 au due to fieldline meandering.},
