 abstract = {Drifts are known to play a role in galactic cosmic ray transport within
the heliosphere and are a standard component of cosmic ray
propagation models. However, the current paradigm of solar
energetic particle (SEP) propagation holds the effects of drifts
to be negligible, and they are not accounted for in most current
SEP modeling efforts. We present full-orbit test particle
simulations of SEP propagation in a Parker spiral interplanetary
magnetic field (IMF), which demonstrate that high-energy
particle drifts cause significant asymmetric propagation
perpendicular to the IMF. Thus in many cases the assumption of
field-aligned propagation of SEPs may not be valid. We show that
SEP drifts have dependencies on energy, heliographic latitude,
and charge-to-mass ratio that are capable of transporting
energetic particles perpendicular to the field over significant
distances within interplanetary space, e.g., protons of initial
energy 100 MeV propagate distances across the field on the order
of 1 AU, over timescales typical of a gradual SEP event. Our
results demonstrate the need for current models of SEP events to
include the effects of particle drift. We show that the drift is
considerably stronger for heavy ion SEPs due to their larger
mass-to-charge ratio. This paradigm shift has important
consequences for the modeling of SEP events and is crucial to
the understanding and interpretation of in situ observations.},
