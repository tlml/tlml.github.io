 abstract = {In the full-orbit particle simulations of energetic particle transport
in plasmas, the plasma turbulence is typically described as a
homogeneous superposition of linear Fourier modes. The
turbulence evolution is, however, typically a nonlinear process,
and, particularly in the heliospheric context, the solar wind
plasma is inhomogeneous due to the transient structures, as
observed by remote and in situ measurements. In this work, we
study the effects of the inhomogeneities on energetic particle
transport by using spatially distributed, superposed turbulence
envelopes. We find that the cross-field transport is
significantly reduced, when compared to the results obtained
with homogeneous turbulence. The reduction can reach an order of
magnitude when the enveloping breaks the wave phase coherence
along the mean magnetic field direction.},
