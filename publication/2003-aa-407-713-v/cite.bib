 abstract = {Alfvén wave transport in the solar wind, including non-linear
spectral energy transfer, is studied. We present numerical
solutions of wave transport using a diffusive flux function
previously introduced for spectral energy transfer, and compare
it with the analytical solution obtained for a convective flux
function. The two models of cascading produce very similar
behavior of a power spectrum initially of 1/f-form at the solar
surface, provided that the cascading constants are tuned to
produce the same spectral flux in the inertial range. We present
an analytical expression for the power spectrum of the
diffusively-cascading Alfvén waves in the solar wind derived
from a solution of the wave transport equation and show that it
compares well with the exact solutions. Our expression enables
(semi) analytical evaluation of the cyclotron heating rate, the
wave pressure gradient, and the energetic-particle mean free
path related to the Alfvén waves in the corona and solar
wind.},
