 abstract = {The trajectories of solar energetic particles in an interplanetary
magnetic field exhibiting large-scale fluctuations due to
footpoint motions originating in the photosphere are simulated
using a full-orbit test-particle code. The cross-field transport
experienced by the particles in three propagation conditions
(scatter-free, with scattering mean free path
\ensuremathłambda = 0.3 AU and \ensuremathłambda = 2
AU) is characterized in the Parker spiral geometry. The role of
expansion of the magnetic field with radial distance from the
Sun is taken into consideration in the calculation of particle
displacements and diffusion coefficients from the output of the
simulations. It is found that transport across the magnetic
field is enhanced in the \ensuremathłambda = 0.3 AU and
\ensuremathłambda = 2 AU cases, compared to the scatter-
free case. Values of the ratios of perpendicular to parallel
diffusion coefficients vary between 0.01 and 0.08. The ratio of
latitudinal to longitudinal diffusion coefficient perpendicular
to the magnetic field is typically 0.2, suggesting that
transport in latitude may be less efficient.},
