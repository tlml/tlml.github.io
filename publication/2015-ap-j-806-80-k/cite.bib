 abstract = {With the first observations of solar \ensuremathγ-rays from the
decay of pions, the relationship of protons producing ground
level enhancements (GLEs) on the Earth to those of similar
energies producing the \ensuremathγ-rays on the Sun has
been debated. These two populations may be either independent
and simply coincident in large flares, or they may be, in fact,
the same population stemming from a single accelerating agent
and jointly distributed at the Sun and also in space. Assuming
the latter, we model a scenario in which particles are
accelerated near the Sun in a shock wave with a fraction
transported back to the solar surface to radiate, while the
remainder is detected at Earth in the form of a GLE.
Interplanetary ions versus ions interacting at the Sun are
studied for a spherical shock wave propagating in a radial
magnetic field through a highly turbulent radial ray (the
acceleration core) and surrounding weakly turbulent sector in
which the accelerated particles can propagate toward or away
from the Sun. The model presented here accounts for both the
first-order Fermi acceleration at the shock front and the
second-order, stochastic re-acceleration by the turbulence
enhanced behind the shock. We find that the re-acceleration is
important in generating the \ensuremathγ-radiation and
we also find that up to 10% of the particle population can find
its way to the Sun as compared to particles escaping to the
interplanetary space.},
