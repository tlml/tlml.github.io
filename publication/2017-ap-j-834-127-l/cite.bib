 abstract = {Current particle transport models describe the propagation of charged
particles across the mean field direction in turbulent plasmas
as diffusion. However, recent studies suggest that at short
timescales, such as soon after solar energetic particle (SEP)
injection, particles remain on turbulently meandering field
lines, which results in nondiffusive initial propagation across
the mean magnetic field. In this work, we use a new technique to
investigate how the particles are displaced from their original
field lines, and we quantify the parameters of the transition
from field-aligned particle propagation along meandering field
lines to particle diffusion across the mean magnetic field. We
show that the initial decoupling of the particles from the field
lines is slow, and particles remain within a Larmor radius from
their initial meandering field lines for tens to hundreds of
Larmor periods, for 0.1-10 MeV protons in turbulence conditions
typical of the solar wind at 1 au. Subsequently, particles
decouple from their initial field lines and after hundreds to
thousands of Larmor periods reach time-asymptotic diffusive
behavior consistent with particle diffusion across the mean
field caused by the meandering of the field lines. We show that
the typical duration of the prediffusive phase, hours to tens of
hours for 10 MeV protons in 1 au solar wind turbulence
conditions, is significant for SEP propagation to 1 au and must
be taken into account when modeling SEP propagation in the
interplanetary space.},
