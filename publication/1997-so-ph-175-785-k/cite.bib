 abstract = {We analysed the solar particle event following the 9 July 1996 solar
flare. High-energy protons were detected by the ERNE instrument
on board SOHO. Anisotropy of arriving protons revealed very
peculiar non-monotonic development. A short period of almost
isotropic distribution was imbedded into the prolonged period of
beam-like distribution of 14 17 MeV protons. This implies the
existence of a narrow magnetic channel with a much smaller mean
free path than in the surrounding quiet solar wind plasma. We
used Monte Carlo simulations of interplanetary transport to fit
the observed anisotropies and intensity time profiles. Proton
injection and transport parameters are estimated. The injection
scenario is found to be very close to the scenario of the 24 May
1990 event, but the intensity and the interplanetary transport
parameters are different. The extreme anisotropy observed
implies prolonged injection of high-energy protons at the Sun
and at the interplanetary shock front, and either a very large
mean free path (\ensuremath≥ 5 AU) outside the slow
transport channel, or alternatively, a somewhat smaller mean
free path (\ensuremath≈2 AU) and enhanced focusing
between the Sun and the Earth.},
