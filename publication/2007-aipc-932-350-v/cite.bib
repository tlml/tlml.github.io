 abstract = {Recent efforts on modeling coronal turbulence transport and shock
acceleration self-consistently are reviewed. The considered
models are based on the assumption that the turbulence
responsible for the scattering of energetic ions consists of
slab-mode Alfv√©n waves. A short discussion of the applied
wave transport equation and particle transport coefficients is
followed by a more extensive review of analytical and numerical
modeling results of coupled evolution of energetic particle
fluxes and wave intensities.},
