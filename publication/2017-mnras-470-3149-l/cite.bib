 abstract = {Propagation of energetic particles across the mean field direction in
turbulent magnetic fields is often described as spatial
diffusion. Recently, it has been suggested that initially the
particles propagate systematically along meandering field lines,
and only later reach the time-asymptotic diffusive cross-field
propagation. In this paper, we analyse cross-field propagation
of 1-100 MeV protons in composite 2D-slab turbulence superposed
on a constant background magnetic field, using full-orbit
particle simulations, to study the non-diffusive phase of
particle propagation with a wide range of turbulence parameters.
We show that the early-time non-diffusive propagation of the
particles is consistent with particle propagation along
turbulently meandering field lines. This results in a wide
cross-field extent of the particles already at the initial
arrival of particles to a given distance along the mean field
direction, unlike when using spatial diffusion particle
transport models. The cross-field extent of the particle
distribution remains constant for up to tens of hours in
turbulence environment consistent with the inner heliosphere
during solar energetic particle events. Subsequently, the
particles escape from their initial meandering field lines, and
the particle propagation across the mean field reaches time-
asymptotic diffusion. Our analysis shows that in order to
understand solar energetic particle event origins, particle
transport modelling must include non-diffusive particle
propagation along meandering field lines.},
