 abstract = {Observations and modeling suggest that the fluctuations in magnetized
plasmas exhibit scale-dependent anisotropy, with more energy in
the fluctuations perpendicular to the mean magnetic field than
in the parallel fluctuations and the anisotropy increasing at
smaller scales. The scale dependence of the anisotropy has not
been studied in full-orbit simulations of particle transport in
turbulent plasmas so far. In this paper, we construct a model of
critically balanced turbulence, as suggested by Goldreich &
Sridhar, and calculate energetic particle spatial diffusion
coefficients using full-orbit simulations. The model uses an
enveloped turbulence approach, where each two-dimensional wave
mode with wavenumber k $_</SUB> is packed into envelopes of
length L following the critical balance condition, Lvpropk
$^-2/3$ <SUB>$, with the wave mode parameters changing
between envelopes. Using full-orbit particle simulations, we
find that both the parallel and perpendicular diffusion
coefficients increase by a factor of two, compared to previous
models with scale-independent anisotropy.},
