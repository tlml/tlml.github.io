 abstract = {We have developed a steady state two-fluid description of the radial
solar wind expansion close to the coronal base. The model is
formulated self-consistently with respect to the radial
evolution of turbulence by supplementing the moment equations of
the plasma with an equation describing the radial evolution of
the Alfv√©n wave power as originally suggested by [1984]. We
assume that there is sufficient wave power in the ion-cyclotron
frequency range and determine the resulting acceleration and
heating rates of the thermal plasma in the corona and
interplanetary space. In improvement of earlier models of the
nonlocal dynamics of the expanding corona, the dissipation
frequency is determined self-consistently from the ion-cyclotron
damping rate. After demonstrating that the time-independent
modeling can correctly reproduce the solutions obtained with (in
the above sense) non-self-consistent models, the significance of
the self-consistent treatment is pointed out. The new solutions
are studied in detail, and their implications for the transport
of solar energetic particles are discussed.},
