 abstract = {The results of full-orbit test-particle simulations of SEPs propagating
through an IMF which exhibits large-scale fluctuations are
presented. A variety of propagation conditions are simulated -
scatter-free, and scattering with mean free path,
\ensuremathłambda, of 0.3 and 2.0 AU - and the cross-field
transport of SEPs is investigated. When calculating cross-field
displacements the Parker spiral geometry is accounted for and
the role of magnetic field expansion is taken into account. It
is found that transport across the magnetic field is enhanced in
the \ensuremathłambda =0.3 AU and \ensuremathłambda =2
AU cases, compared to the scatter-free case, with the
\ensuremathłambda =2 AU case in particular containing
outlying particles that had strayed a large distance across the
IMF. Outliers are catergorized by means of Chauvenet's criterion
and it is found that typically between 1 and 2% of the
population falls within this category. The ratio of latitudinal
to longitudinal diffusion coefficient perpendicular to the
magnetic field is typically 0.2, suggesting that transport in
latitude is less efficient.},
