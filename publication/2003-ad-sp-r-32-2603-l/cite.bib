 abstract = {The solar wind wave heating models require substantial amount of wave
power in order to efficiently heat and accelerate solar wind.
The level of fluctuations is however limited by energetic
particle observations. The simplest cyclotron sweep models
result in convection-dominated transport, contradicting
observations. However, models incorporating wave-wave
-interactions, which cause wave energy to cascade in wavenumber,
allow more reasonable energetic particle transport in the
interplanetary space. The mean free path of the energetic
particles remains still relatively short in the corona,
providing favorable conditions for coronal mass ejection (CME)
related shock acceleration. We study the consequences of this
scenario on the energetic particle production related to CMEs.
The role of self-generated waves is also discussed.},
