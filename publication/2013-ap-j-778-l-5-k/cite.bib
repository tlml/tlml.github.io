 abstract = {Major solar energetic particle events are associated with shock waves in
solar corona and solar wind. Fast scattering of charged
particles by plasma turbulence near the shock wave increases the
efficiency of the particle acceleration in the shock, but
prevents particles from escaping ahead of the shock. However,
the turbulence energy levels in neighboring magnetic tubes of
solar wind may differ from each other by more than one order of
magnitude. We present the first theoretical study of accelerated
particle emission from an oblique shock wave propagating through
an intermittent turbulence background that consists of both
highly turbulent magnetic tubes, where particles are
accelerated, and quiet tubes, via which the accelerated
particles can escape to the non-shocked solar wind. The modeling
results imply that the presence of the fast transport channels
penetrating the shock and cross-field transport of accelerated
particles to those channels may play a key role in high-energy
particle emission from distant shocks and can explain the prompt
onset of major solar energetic particle events observed near the
Earth's orbit.},
