 abstract = {We analyze the high-energy particle emission from the Sun in two extreme
solar particle events in which protons are accelerated to
relativistic energies and can cause a significant signal even in
the ground-based particle detectors. Analysis of a relativistic
proton event is based on modeling of the particle transport and
interaction, from a near-Sun source through the solar wind and
the Earth\textquoterights magnetosphere and atmosphere to a
detector on the ground. This allows us to deduce the time
profile of the proton source at the Sun and compare it with
observed electromagnetic emissions. The 1998 May 2 event is
associated with a flare and a coronal mass ejection (CME), which
were well observed by the Nan√ßay Radioheliograph, thus the
images of the radio sources are available. For the 2003 November
2 event, the low corona images of the CME liftoff obtained at
the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory are available. Those
complementary data sets are analyzed jointly with the broadband
dynamic radio spectra, EUV images, and other data available for
both events. We find a common scenario for both eruptions,
including the flare\textquoterights dual impulsive phase, the
CME-launch-associated decimetric-continuum burst, and the late,
low-frequency type III radio bursts at the time of the
relativistic proton injection into the interplanetary medium.
The analysis supports the idea that the two considered events
start with emission of relativistic protons previously
accelerated during the flare and CME launch, then trapped in
large-scale magnetic loops and later released by the expanding
CME.},
