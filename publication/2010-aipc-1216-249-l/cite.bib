 abstract = {The onset of a Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) event has been
traditionally determined by using the velocity dispersion
analysis (VDA), where the event onset at the Sun is determined
by fitting the solar onset time and the particles' path length
to match the observed event onset at 1 AU for several SEP energy
channels. This approach has been studied by using energetic
particle simulations, in order to understand the effect of the
interplanetary scattering on the arrival time of the first
particles to 1 AU. In these studies, the SEP event onset at 1 AU
has been defined as the time when the intensities reach certain
percentage of the maximum of the event. This is often not
feasible for practical work, as a real event may be complex in
its structure, and the pre-event background may mask the SEP
onset to differing degrees in different energies. In order to
estimate the usability of the VDA method, we study the simulated
SEP onset on a pre-existing particle background by varying the
pre-event background level, the difference of the pre-event
background and the simulated event maximum spectral indices, the
interplanetary mean free path and the injection profile. As in
the previous studies, we find that large path length variation
can be explained as an artifact resulting from the use of the
VDA method. More importantly, the error in the obtained solar
onset time depends strongly on the properties of the pre-event
background.},
