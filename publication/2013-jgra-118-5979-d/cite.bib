 abstract = {Drifts in the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field are known to
be an important component in the propagation of galactic cosmic
rays, while they are thought to be negligible for solar
energetic particles (SEPs). As a result, they have so far been
ignored in SEP propagation modeling and data analysis. We
examine drift velocities in the Parker spiral within single
particle first-order adiabatic theory, in a local coordinate
system with an axis parallel to the magnetic field. We show
that, in the presence of scattering in interplanetary space,
protons at the high end of the SEP energy range experience
significant gradient and curvature drift. In the scatter-free
case, drift due to magnetic field curvature is present. The
magnitude of drift velocity increases by more than an order of
magnitude at high heliographic latitudes compared to near the
ecliptic; it has a strong dependence on radial distance r from
the Sun, reaching a maximum at r\ensuremath∼1 AU at low
heliolatitudes and r\ensuremath∼10 AU at high
heliolatitudes. Due to the mass over charge dependence of drift
velocities, the effect of drift for partially ionized SEP heavy
ions is stronger than for protons. Drift is therefore likely to
be a considerable source of cross-field transport for high-
energy SEPs.},
