 abstract = {Gamma-ray emission during long-duration gamma-ray flare (LDGRF) events
is thought to be caused mainly by $>$300 MeV protons interacting
with the ambient plasma at or near the photosphere. Prolonged
periods of the gamma-ray emission have prompted the suggestion
that the source of the energetic protons is acceleration at a
coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock, followed by particle
back-precipitation onto the solar atmosphere over extended
times. We study the latter hypothesis using test particle
simulations, which allow us to investigate whether scattering
associated with turbulence aids particles in overcoming the
effect of magnetic mirroring, which impedes back-precipitation
by reflecting particles as they travel sunwards. The
instantaneous precipitation fraction, $P$, the proportion of
protons that successfully precipitate for injection at a fixed
height, $r_i$, is studied as a function of scattering mean free
path, $łambda$ and $r_i$. Upper limits to the total
precipitation fraction, $øverlineP$, were calculated for
eight LDGRF events for moderate scattering conditions
($łambda$=0.1 au). We find that the presence of scattering
helps back-precipitation compared to the scatter-free case,
although at very low $łambda$ values outward convection with
the solar wind ultimately dominates. For eight LDGRF events, due
to strong mirroring, $øverlineP$ is very small, between 0.56
and 0.93% even in the presence of scattering. Time-extended
acceleration and large total precipitation fractions, as seen in
the observations, cannot be reconciled for a moving shock source
according to our simulations. Therefore, it is not possible to
obtain both long duration $γ$ ray emission and efficient
precipitation within this scenario. These results challenge the
CME shock source scenario as the main mechanism for $γ$ ray
production in LDGRFs.},
