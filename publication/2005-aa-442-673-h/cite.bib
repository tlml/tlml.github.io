 abstract = {We determine the proton and helium nuclei release times at the Sun for
25 SEP events within the time period May 8, 1996-June 20, 2001,
and compare them to each other. The event onset times at 1 AU
are determined with a Poisson-CUSUM method, and the solar
release times are obtained by the velocity dispersion analysis.
Velocity dispersions were derived in the energy range 14-51
MeV/n. If the release times of protons and helium nuclei do not
overlap within their error limits, and if protons are released
earlier than helium, then the helium event is defined as
``delayed''. Seventeen helium events (68%) were found to be
``delayed'' and only eight (32%) ``non-delayed''. The average
delay was (34 \ensuremathÂ± 18) minutes. The event-related
flare location had an important role in the ``non-delayed''
events. A significant difference was found in the helium-to-
proton ratios at the time of maximum intensity of the
``delayed'' and ``non-delayed'' events. No clear evidence was
found that the ``delayed'' and ``non-delayed'' events would
correspond the classical gradual-impulsive division of SEP
events. We find that the delay is related to the poor magnetic
connection between the flare site and the spacecraft.},
