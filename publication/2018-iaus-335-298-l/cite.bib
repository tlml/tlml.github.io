 abstract = {Forecasting Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) fluence, as integrated over
an SEP event, is an important element when estimating the effect
of solar eruptions on humans and technology in space. Current
real-time estimates are based on SEP measurements at a single
location in space. However, the interplanetary magnetic field
corotates with the Sun approximately 13° each day
with respect to Earth, thus in 4 days a near-Earth spacecraft
will have changed their connection about 60° from
the original SEP source. We estimate the effect of the
corotation on particle fluence using a simple particle transport
model, and show that ignoring corotation can cause up to an
order of magnitude error in fluence estimations, depending on
the interplanetary particle transport conditions. We compare the
model predictions with STEREO observations of SEP events.},
