 abstract = {Using spaceborne particle and gamma-ray detection and radio diagnostics
we study solar energetic particle (SEP) production in the 1996
July 9 event. This event is associated with an impulsive soft
X-ray flare (9:10 UT) and a coronal mass ejection (CME). In a
global classification the event is considered as mixed-
impulsive. A sequence of acceleration processes is identified,
starting early in the flare impulsive phase and continuing
throughout the period when the CME propagated up to several
R$_solar$ above the photosphere: (1) Gamma-ray, hard X-ray and
cm-wave emitting particles seen during the flare impulsive phase
in the low corona had no counterpart at the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) spacecraft. (2) Electrons
accelerated at a coronal shock wave were revealed by decimetric-
to-metric type II radio emission and by simultaneous radio
signatures of beams traveling to 1 AU. (3) Mildly relativistic
(>=250 keV) electrons detected by SoHO did not correspond to
these shock-accelerated populations, but to later mainly
impulsive injection which was associated with radio brightenings
over a large range of coronal altitudes. (4) Energetic protons
detected by SoHO were accelerated during about 100 min after the
flare impulsive phase with a gradually evolving production
profile that bore some similarity with the time profile of
broadband metric (type IV) emission. (5) While all other
particle signatures decayed, a second period of interplanetary
proton production took place >=2 hours after flare onset. The
first, 100 min period of SEP acceleration, post-impulsive phase
coronal acceleration, is definitely dominant in mildly
relativistic electrons. Two acceleration periods nearly equally
contribute to the production of åisebox-0.5ex~
20 MeV protons. However, the second period is more productive in
low energy, \i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 1 MeV, protons. The
timing of the SEP injections indicates that neither the
impulsive flare acceleration in the low corona nor the
interplanetary CME at >= 10 R$_solar$ are the main sources of
the high-energy particles observed onboard SoHO. We suggest that
various acceleration processes related to the reconfiguration of
the corona in the course of the flare and CME lift-off
contribute to the interacting and escaping particle populations,
with different signatures at different energies and in different
species.},
