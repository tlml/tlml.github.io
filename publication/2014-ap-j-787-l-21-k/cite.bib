 abstract = {While major solar energetic particle (SEP) events are associated with
coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shocks in solar wind,
accurate SEP measurements reveal that more than one component of
energetic ions exist in the beginning of the events. Solar
electromagnetic emissions, including nuclear gamma-rays, suggest
that high-energy ions could also be accelerated by coronal
shocks, and some of those particles could contribute to SEPs in
interplanetary space. However, the CME-driven shock in solar
wind is thought to shield any particle source beneath the shock
because of the strong scattering required for the diffusive
shock acceleration. In this Letter, we consider a shock model
that allows energetic particles from the possible behind-shock
source to appear in front of the shock simultaneously with SEPs
accelerated by the shock itself. We model the energetic particle
transport in directions parallel and perpendicular to the
magnetic field in a spherical shock expanding through the highly
turbulent magnetic sector with an embedded quiet magnetic tube,
which makes the shock semi-transparent for energetic particles.
The model energy spectra and time profiles of energetic ions
escaping far upstream of the shock are similar to the profiles
observed during the first hour of some gradual SEP events.},
