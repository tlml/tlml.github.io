 abstract = {The observations of the ERNE instrument on-board the SOHO spacecraft are
analysed. The main period under study is from the beginning of
May till mid-October 1996. Only very small energetic particle
events were observed. A comparison of the ERNE measurements with
energetic particle observations during the two previous solar
minima indicates that the flux levels of protons during the
first half of 1996 are exceptionally low. The daily counting
rates of quiet-time protons and 4̂He in the energy range 13-100
MeV/nucleon show statistically significant variations with time.
Following two energetic particle events in July and August,
anticorrelations were found between enhancements of low energy
protons in the range 1.5-8 MeV, possibly accelerated in a
corotating interaction region, and the modulation of high energy
protons and helium above 13 MeV/nucleon. The period of the
observed anticorrelations coincide with the solar rotation
period.},
