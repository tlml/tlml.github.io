 abstract = {Context. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) with energy in the GeV range
can propagate to Earth from their acceleration region near the
Sun and produce ground level enhancements (GLEs). The
traditional approach to interpreting and modelling GLE
observations assumes particle propagation which is only parallel
to the magnetic field lines of interplanetary space, that is,
spatially 1D propagation. Recent measurements by PAMELA have
characterised SEP properties at 1 AU for the
\ensuremathâˆ¼100 MeV-1 GeV range at high spectral
resolution. \ Aims: We model the transport of GLE-
energy solar protons using a 3D approach to assess the effect of
the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) and drifts associated to
the gradient and curvature of the Parker spiral. We derive 1 AU
observables and compare the simulation results with data from
PAMELA. \ Methods: We use a 3D test particle model
including a HCS. Monoenergetic populations are studied first to
obtain a qualitative picture of propagation patterns and numbers
of crossings of the 1 AU sphere. Simulations for power law
injection are used to derive intensity profiles and fluence
spectra at 1 AU. A simulation for a specific event, GLE 71, is
used for comparison purposes with PAMELA data. \
Results: Spatial patterns of 1 AU crossings and the average
number of crossings per particle are strongly influenced by 3D
effects, with significant differences between periods of A$^+$
and A$^-$ polarities. The decay time constant of 1 AU
intensity profiles varies depending on the position of the
observer and it is not a simple function of the mean free path
as in 1D models. Energy dependent leakage from the injection
flux tube is particularly important for GLE energy particles,
resulting in a rollover in the spectrum.},
