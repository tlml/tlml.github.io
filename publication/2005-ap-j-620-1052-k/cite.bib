 abstract = {Recent observations on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
(SOHO) indicate that acceleration of solar energetic particles
(SEPs) at intermediate scales in the solar corona, between flare
acceleration and interplanetary CME-driven shock acceleration,
significantly contributes to the production of >10 MeV protons.
Coronal shocks seem to be the most plausible candidate for the
post-impulsive phase acceleration, which emits
Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~1-100 MeV protons into the
interplanetary medium for about 1 hr after the flare. We have
employed a Monte Carlo technique to model the diffusive shock
acceleration of protons in a turbulent layer at the base of the
solar wind. We find that a power-law spectrum of energetic
protons can be emitted from the trailing turbulent layer left
behind the shock into the solar wind for a few tens of minutes
after the CME liftoff. In contrast to an earlier expectation,
the propagation direction of the shock wave is found not to be
crucial. Both outward-propagating and refracting shocks can load
the corona with energetic protons. Those protons escape into the
interplanetary medium well after the passage of the shock. We
have studied successive transformations of the particle spectra
during shock acceleration, coronal transport, and possible
reacceleration, for different populations of seed particles. The
simulated production time profiles and energy spectra are found
to be consistent with observations of the 1996 July 9 event by
the Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron (ERNE)
instrument on board SOHO. The new model can be easily combined
with our previous interplanetary transport models, forming a
basis on which to interpret SEP observations made at 1 AU.},
