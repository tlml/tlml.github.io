 abstract = {To understand the origin of Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs), we must
study their injection time relative to other solar eruption
manifestations. Traditionally the injection time is determined
using the Velocity Dispersion Analysis (VDA) where a linear fit
of the observed event onset times at 1 AU to the inverse
velocities of SEPs is used to derive the injection time and path
length of the first-arriving particles. VDA does not, however,
take into account that the particles that produce a
statistically observable onset at 1 AU have scattered in the
interplanetary space. We use Monte Carlo test particle
simulations of energetic protons to study the effect of particle
scattering on the observable SEP event onset above pre-event
background, and consequently on VDA results. We find that the
VDA results are sensitive to the properties of the pre-event and
event particle spectra as well as SEP injection and scattering
parameters. In particular, a VDA-obtained path length that is
close to the nominal Parker spiral length does not imply that
the VDA injection time is correct. We study the delay to the
observed onset caused by scattering of the particles and derive
a simple estimate for the delay time by using the rate of
intensity increase at the SEP onset as a parameter. We apply the
correction to a magnetically well-connected SEP event of 2000
June 10, and show it to improve both the path length and
injection time estimates, while also increasing the error limits
to better reflect the inherent uncertainties of VDA.},
