 abstract = {Context. Acceleration in coronal mass ejection driven shocks is
currently considered the primary source of large solar energetic
particle events. Aims. The solar wind, which feeds shock-
accelerated particles, includes numerous ion populations, which
offer much insight into acceleration processes. We present first
simulations of shock-accelerated minor ions, in order to explore
trapping dynamics and acceleration timescales in detail.
Methods. We have simulated diffusive shock acceleration of minor
ions ($^3$He$^2+$, $^4$He$^2+$, $^16$O$^6+$ and
$^56$Fe$^14+$) and protons using a Monte Carlo method, where
self-generated Alfv√©nic turbulence allows for repeated shock
crossings and acceleration to high energies. Results. We present
the effect of minor ions on wave generation, especially at low
wavenumbers, and show that it is significant. We find that
maximum ion energy is determined by the competing effects of
particle escape due to focusing in an expanding flux tube and
trapping due to the amplified turbulence. We show the dependence
of cut-off energy on the particle charge to mass ratio to be
approximately (Q/A)$^1.5$. Conclusions. We suggest that
understanding the acceleration of minor ions at coronal shocks
requires simulations which allow us to explore trapping dynamics
and acceleration timescales in detail, including evolution of
the turbulent trapping boundary. We conclude that steady-state
models do not adequately describe the acceleration of heavy ions
in coronal shocks.},
