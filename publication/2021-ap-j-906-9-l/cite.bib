 abstract = {Cosmic-ray (CR) fluxes in the heliosphere are affected by the transient
interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), causing so-called
Forbush decreases (FDs), characterized by a decline of up to
25% in the neutron monitor counts at the Earth's surface,
lasting up to over a week. FDs are thought to be caused by the
ICME shock wave or the magnetic flux rope embedded in the ICME
inhibiting CR propagation through the ICME structure. FDs are
typically modeled as enhanced diffusion within the ICME
structure. However, so far modeling has not considered the
access of the CRs from the interplanetary field lines into the
isolated magnetic field lines of the ICME flux rope. We study
the effect of an ICME flux rope on particle propagation by using
full-orbit particle simulations, with the interface between the
external interplanetary magnetic field and the isolated flux
rope field lines modeled analytically. We find that the
particles can access the flux rope through the x-point region,
where the external magnetic fields cancel the azimuthal
component of the rope field. The transport through this region
is fast compared to diffusive radial propagation within the
rope. As a result, the propagation of CRs into the flux rope can
be modeled as diffusion into a cylinder. The density cavity
within the rope is asymmetric, and limited to the magnetic field
lines isolated from the external field. Thus, in order to
evaluate the role of the flux rope in FDs, one must analyze the
extent of the region where the flux rope magnetic field lines
are separated from the interplanetary magnetic fields.},
