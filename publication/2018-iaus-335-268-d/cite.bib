 abstract = {Modelling of Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) is usually carried out by
means of the 1D focused transport equation and the same approach
is adopted within several SEP Space Weather forecasting
frameworks. We present an alternative approach, based on test
particle simulations, which naturally describes 3D particle
propagation. The SPARX forecasting system is an example of how
test particle simulations can be used in real time in a Space
Weather context. SPARX is currently operational within the
COMESEP Alert System. The performance of the system, which is
triggered by detection of a solar flare of class >M1.0 is
evaluated by comparing forecasts for flare events between 1997
and 2017 with actual SEP data from the GOES spacecraft.},
