 abstract = {We have analyzed five solar energetic particle (SEP) events observed
aboard the SOHO spacecraft during 1996 1997. All events were
associated with impulsive soft X-ray flares, Type II radio
bursts and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Most attention is
concentrated on the SEP acceleration during the first 100
minutes after the flare impulsive phase, post-impulsive-phase
acceleration, being observed in eruptions centered at different
solar longitudes. As a representative pattern of a (nearly)
well-connected event, we consider the west flare and CME of 9
July 1996 (S10 W30). Similarities and dissimilarities of the
post-impulsive-phase acceleration at large heliocentric-angle
distance from the eruption center are illustrated with the 24
September 1997 event (S31 E19). We conclude that the proton
acceleration at intermediate scales, between flare acceleration
and interplanetary CME-driven shock acceleration, significantly
contributes to the production of \ensuremath\gtrsim10 MeV
protons. This post-impulsive-phase acceleration seems to be
caused by the CME lift-off.},
