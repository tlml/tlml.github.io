 abstract = {We present a test-particle model of diffusive shock acceleration on open
coronal field lines based on one-dimensional diffusion-
convection equation with finite upstream and downstream
diffusion regions. We calculate the energy spectrum of protons
escaping into the interplanetary space and that of protons
interacting with the subcoronal material producing observable
secondary emissions. Our model can account for the observed
power-law and broken power-law energy spectra as well as the
values of the order of unity for the ratio of the interplanetary
to interacting protons. We compare our model to Monte Carlo
simulations of parallel shock acceleration including the effects
of the diverging magnetic field. A good agreement between the
models is found if (i) the upstream diffusion length is much
smaller than the scale length L$_B$ of the large-scale
magnetic field, \ensuremathąppa$_1$/U$_1$<<L$_B$,
where U$_1$ is the upstream scattering center speed and
\ensuremath\p̨pa$_1$(p) is the momentum dependent
upstream diffusion coefficent; (ii) the downstream diffusion
length is much smaller than the length of the downstream
diffusive region L$_2$, for which L$_2$<<L$_B$ has to be
satisfied; and (iii) most of the particles are injected to the
acceleration process within a couple of L$_B$'s above the
solar surface. We emphasize that concurrently produced
interplanetary and interacting protons can be used as probes of
turbulence in the vicinity of the shock; our model has two
turbulence parameters, the scattering-center compression ratio
at the shock and the number of diffusion lengths in the upstream
region, that may be experimentally determined if the
interplanetary and interacting proton spectra are measured.},
