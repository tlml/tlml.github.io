 abstract = {The Sun, driving a supersonic solar wind, cuts out of the local
interstellar medium a giant plasma bubble, the heliosphere. ESA,
jointly with NASA, has had an important role in the development
of our current understanding of the Suns\textquoteright
immediate neighborhood. Ulysses is the only spacecraft exploring
the third, out-of-ecliptic dimension, while SOHO has allowed us
to better understand the influence of the Sun and to image the
glow of interstellar matter in the heliosphere. Voyager 1 has
recently encountered the innermost boundary of this plasma
bubble, the termination shock, and is returning exciting yet
puzzling data of this remote region. The next logical step is to
leave the heliosphere and to thereby map out in unprecedented
detail the structure of the outer heliosphere and its
boundaries, the termination shock, the heliosheath, the
heliopause, and, after leaving the heliosphere, to discover the
true nature of the hydrogen wall, the bow shock, and the local
interstellar medium beyond. This will greatly advance our
understanding of the heliosphere that is the best-known example
for astrospheres as found around other stars. Thus, IHP/HEX will
allow us to discover, explore, and understand fundamental
astrophysical processes in the largest accessible plasma
laboratory, the heliosphere.},
