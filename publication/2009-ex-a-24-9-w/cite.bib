 abstract = {The Sun, driving a supersonic solar wind, cuts out of the local
interstellar medium a giant plasma bubble, the heliosphere. ESA,
jointly with NASA, has had an important role in the development
of our current understanding of the Suns immediate neighborhood.
Ulysses is the only spacecraft exploring the third, out-of-
ecliptic dimension, while SOHO has allowed us to better
understand the influence of the Sun and to image the glow of
interstellar matter in the heliosphere. Voyager 1 has recently
encountered the innermost boundary of this plasma bubble, the
termination shock, and is returning exciting yet puzzling data
of this remote region. The next logical step is to leave the
heliosphere and to thereby map out in unprecedented detail the
structure of the outer heliosphere and its boundaries, the
termination shock, the heliosheath, the heliopause, and, after
leaving the heliosphere, to discover the true nature of the
hydrogen wall, the bow shock, and the local interstellar medium
beyond. This will greatly advance our understanding of the
heliosphere that is the best-known example for astrospheres as
found around other stars. Thus, IHP/HEX will allow us to
discover, explore, and understand fundamental astrophysical
processes in the largest accessible plasma laboratory, the
heliosphere.},
