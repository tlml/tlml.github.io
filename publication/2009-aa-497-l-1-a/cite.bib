 abstract = {On 2001 October 19-21 the Energetic and Relativistic Nuclei and Electron
(ERNE) instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
(SOHO) observed two gradual solar energetic particle (SEP)
events separated by 15 h, in association with two X1.6/2B solar
flares and halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The observational
data suggest that the second acceleration of
Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~10-100 MeV protons occurred
behind the first CME and the previous CME was not an obstacle
for new particles to directly reach 1 AU. The proton flux
anisotropy data support the idea that the particle production
significantly declined in about 10 h after the shock wave
started, while the prolonged temporal profile of the solar
energetic particle event was due to a slow transport of
previously accelerated particles in the interplanetary space.
These observations call into question the view that in all
gradual events high-energy particles are continuously produced
at a CME bow shock as it travels from near the Sun to beyond 1
AU.},
