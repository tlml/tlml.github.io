 abstract = {Solar energetic particles (SEPs) have been observed to easily spread
across heliographic longitudes, and the mechanisms responsible
for this behavior remain unclear. We use full-orbit simulations
of a 10 MeV proton beam in a turbulent magnetic field to study
to what extent the spread across the mean field can be described
as diffusion early in a particle event. We compare the full-
orbit code results to solutions of a Fokker-Planck equation
including spatial and pitch angle diffusion, and of one
including also propagation of the particles along random-walking
magnetic field lines. We find that propagation of the particles
along meandering field lines is the key process determining
their cross-field spread at 1 AU at the beginning of the
simulated event. The mean square displacement of the particles
an hour after injection is an order of magnitude larger than
that given by the diffusion model, indicating that models
employing spatial cross-field diffusion cannot be used to
describe early evolution of an SEP event. On the other hand, the
diffusion of the particles from their initial field lines is
negligible during the first 5 hr, which is consistent with the
observations of SEP intensity dropouts. We conclude that
modeling SEP events must take into account the particle
propagation along meandering field lines for the first 20 hr of
the event.},
