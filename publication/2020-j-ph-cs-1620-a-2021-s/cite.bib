 abstract = {Multi-spacecraft observations of widespread solar energetic particle
(SEP) events indicate that perpendicular (to the mean field)
diffusion is an important SEP transport mechanism. However, this
is in direct contrast to so-called spike and drop-out events,
which indicate very little lateral transport. To better
understand these seemingly incongruous observations, we discuss
the recent progress made towards understanding and implementing
perpendicular diffusion in transport models of SEP electrons.
This includes a re-derivation of the relevant focused transport
equation, a discussion surrounding the correct form of the
pitch-angle dependent perpendicular diffusion coefficient and
what turbulence quantities are needed as input, and how models
lead to degenerate solutions of the particle intensity. Lastly,
we evaluate the validity of a diffusion approach to SEP
transport and conclude that it is valid when examining a large
number of (an ensemble of) events, but that individual SEP
events may exhibit coherent structures related to the magnetic
field turbulence at short timescales that cannot be accounted
for in this modelling approach.},
