 abstract = {Dissipation of turbulence is generally considered as a prime candidate
for the heating and acceleration of solar wind from the corona
throughout the heliosphere, due to radially evolving dissipation
processes and/or cascading of energy to dissipation scales. In
order to model the latter consistently, we must consider the
evolution of cross-helicity when modeling the strength of the
cascade, as the non-linear interactions causing it require
counterstreaming waves. In this paper, we present a simple model
of non-WKB wave reflection from large-scale gradients, and apply
the resulting cross-helicity to evaluate the evolution of the
turbulence spectrum up to 0.3,AU by using a phenomenological
cascade model. The study is restricted to a cascade in
perpendicular direction. We study the ability of this spectral
flux to heat the solar wind, and its dependence on the frequency
of the excited waves. We find that the cascade, and,
subsequently the heating, is considerably stronger than the one
obtained by using ad-hoc modeling of the heating rates. The
heating rate is also found to increase very fast toward the Sun,
unlike the heating rates used in solar wind models capable of
producing reasonable solar wind profiles.},
